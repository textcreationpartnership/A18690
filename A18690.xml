         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Fathers,</hi> it may ſeeme perhaps ſome preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in me, to be thus bold to vſe your LL. names for the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of this Pamphlet, which neither for the matter of it, nor for the occaſion, may ſeeme worthy of the notice or ſight of ſo graue and learned Fathers. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding being drawne to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hereof, partly by the importunity of aduerſaries, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the deſire and expectation of friends, I thought it very requiſite both in reſpect of the cauſe it ſelfe, and in reſpect of mine owne priuate dutie, to offer theſe my ſimple labours to the protection of your LL. The matter hereof in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was only priuate betwixt my ſelfe and a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, one <hi>Paul Spence,</hi> deteined as then in the Caſtle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> now, I know not vpon what occaſion, liuing at his libertie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. But when by ſpeech and report it was drawne to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of publicke ſcandall, the aduerſary bragging in ſecret of a
<pb facs="tcp:8782:3"/> victory, and others doubting what to thinke thereof, becauſe they ſaw not to the contrary, I iudged it neceſſary after long debating &amp; deliberating with my ſelfe, to let all men ſee how litle reaſon there was of any ſuch inſolent tryumph: ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that it might be turned vppon mee for a matter of iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe and blame, if my concealing hereof ſhould cauſe any diſaduantage to the truth, or any diſcredite of that Miniſtery &amp; ſeruice which vnder your LL. I execute in the place where I am. Now I muſt profeſſe that my thus doing, is only for the Citie of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and others thereabout, for their ſatisfaction in this cauſe, wherein I know many of them haue deſired to be ſatisfied. Your LL. are both by ſpeciall occaſion affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the place. I know my paines ſhalbe the better accepted with them, if it ſhall be vouchſafed your LL. gracious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable acceptation. Moreouer, the fauour which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of both your LL of the one, in commending mee to the place where I am: of the other, in yeelding me ſpeciall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage &amp; eountenance therein, hath bound me to yeeld vnto you theſe my firſt frutes, though but as a handful of water, yet a teſtimony of my dutifull and thankfull minde. And if it ſhall finde no other cauſe to be liked of, yet in this I doubt not but it ſhall be approued that it is a iuſt defenſe of truth againſt the vaine cauillations of error. The ſpeciall drift of my writing, is to approue concerning the matters that are heere in hand, our faithful &amp; vpright dealing in alleaging the Fathers againſt the doctrine of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whoſe proctors for a time vſed the name of the catholick church, as a fray-bug to terrifie al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from ſpeaking againſt them. But when they were perforce vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the ſcriptures, they cryed out that wee expounde the ſcriptures amiſſe, and otherwiſe then the auncient Fathers did vnderſtand them. Being further preſſed with the teſtimonies and authorities of the auncient Fathers, they ſtil notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding exclaime that wee abuſe them alſo, and alleage them to
<pb facs="tcp:8782:3"/> other purpoſe then euer they entended. A ſtrange matter that the plaine words both of the ſcriptures and of the Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo expreſly for vs, yet their meaning and purpoſe, as theſe men pretend, ſhould be altogither againſt vs. But whileſt they endeuour to iuſtifie this, either open exclamation, or priuie whiſpering, it is ſtrange to ſee how ſtrangely and madly they deale. <note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 19. 24.</note>

               <hi>There is none perfect amongst them, but ſuch a one as doth not ably cogge and lye.</hi> Indeed lyes cannot be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but by lying, and falſe gloſes muſt ſerue to maintaine falſe and erroneous aſſertions. Which is not a litle to be ſeen in this libell or pamphlet which I haue here to refute, the Authour whereof taketh vpon him lyke a cunnyng Alcumiſt, to turne euery thing into what he liſt, &amp; as if he ſuppoſed vs to be men bewitched and transformed into beaſtes, ſticketh not to make ſuch conſtructions of the ſcriptures and Fathers ſayings, as no man that hath but the common reaſon and vnderſtanding of a man, can but ſee to bee leaudly and vnreaſonably deuiſed. Wherat I ſhould the leſſe maruell, if they were only this mans deuiſe: I would impute this folly to him onely. But now hee hath taken the moſt of them out of their learned Treatiſes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, to which he oft referreth me, as if they were the Oracle of all truth. So that the ſpirit of this phrenſie and madneſſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the heades of them all, whereby it commeth to paſſe that they take delight in thoſe things which they cannot but know to be abſurd. That their maiſters know ſo much, it
<pb facs="tcp:8782:4"/> ſeemeth to vs apparant, for that they forbid their ſcholers and followers to be acquainted with any of our writings wherein theyr abſurdities and falſhoods are layd open: and wheras we in anſwearing them, propoſe both theirs and ours indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all men to be iudged of, they giue their pupils ſome liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to read their bookes, but it is damnation for them to touch any of ours. Such ſchollers would be ſuſpicious of ſuch mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but that they are maruellouſly blinded with preiudice and ſelfe will. Now as many other by other occaſions, ſo I the leaſt of all by occaſion offered to me, haue taken vpon me for this preſent matter, to ſhew I will not ſay how vainly &amp; fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but wickedly and vnſhamefaſtly they deale in peruerting (they call it anſwering) the teſtimonies of the ancient Fathers. What I haue atteined vnto herein, I leaue it to be eſteemed by the wiſe and godly reader, whoſe will and conuenient leyſure doth ſerue to be exerciſed in ſuch readings. Whatſoeuer it is, I commend it to the fauour of your good LL.

            <p>There was in the Caſtle of <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> a Prieſt named <hi>Paule Spence,</hi> not of the Seminary, but begotten to his order as I ſuppoſe, in the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, I went vnto him to haue ſome ſpeech with him concerning his
<pb facs="tcp:8782:5"/> profeſsion. The particulars of our ſpeech either then or after, I will not report, leaſt I ſhould ſeem partial either for my ſelf or againſt him. The concluſion of my ſpeech at that time, was to wiſh him that hee would at ſome conuenient times reſort to my ſtudie, that by the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of my bookes I might, as occaſion ſerued, ſhew him thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and teſtimonies which I ſhould alleage to him. He promiſed that he would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that I would procure him licence. I procured it of my L. the Biſhop lately deceaſed. I came to him againe, and after ſome ſpeech I required the performance of his promiſe. He ſhewed himſelfe too &amp; fro in the matter, and in the end gaue me plaine anſwere that he was reſolued, and ſo he knew I was alſo, and therfore that it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for him ſo to doe. I departed from him. The next newes that I heard, was a report giuen foorth that I had bene with him at the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that hee had ſtopped my mouth that I had nothing to ſay to him. This is the accuſtomed maner of theſe men, who are all ſo ranke of learning, that the verieſt aſſe of them if he do but once braie, is able to aſtoniſh and confound any aduerſary be he neuer ſo learned. I went to him againe, and vrged him as before. He anſwered me in the ſame maner. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting. I receiued his anſwere, and replied
<pb facs="tcp:8782:6"/> to the ſame againe by writing; yet not intending, becauſe it ſtood not with my buſineſſe otherwiſe, to goe any further in this courſe, but only for ſome aduertiſement and inſtruction to him which I ſawe hee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to giue him occaſion of further conference by ſpeech, as I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him in the end. This happened neare the beginning of Lent, in the yeare 1590. Towards Whitſuntide next following, when I thought he had bene quiet and would haue medled no more, he ſent me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere againe written at large to my reply. But the anſwere in truth was none of his owne doing, as is manifeſt partly by his owne confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by that he ſhewed himſelfe a ſtraunger in his owne anſweres, when afterward in ſpeech he was vpbraided with ſome of them by my ſelfe: partly by the muttering report of his owne fellowes, vaunting that though he were able to ſay litle, yet ſome had the matter in hand that were able to ſay inough. He himſelf indeed was not, nor is of able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to doe it, as all men know that haue any knowledge of him. He was neuer of any Vniuerſitie, and both profeſſed and ſhewed himſelf in ſpeech vtterly ignorant of Logicke, wherof his deputie <hi>Anſw.</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth great skill. I omit ſome other matters that I might mention for proofe hereof. But thus I was vnwares drawne from <hi>P. Spence,</hi> to tontrouerſie and diſputation with ſome other ſecret friend of his, who for his learning might take vppon him to bee a defender of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh falſhood. I addreſſed my ſelfe to a confutation of this anſwer, and thought to haue ſent the ſame to M. Spence in writing; but before I had fully perfected it, which was in Iuly or Auguſt following, he was by occaſion of ſome infirmitie as was pretended, ſet free from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment vpon ſuerties, and ſo continueth till this time, neither could I by ſuch meanes as I vſed, bring him foorth to receiue that which I had written. Hereupon haue I bene traduced by the faction as a man conquered and ouercome, as if I taught openly, that which in dealing priuately with an aduerſary I am not able to defend. For the auoyding of this ſcandall, I was diuerſe times motioned to publiſh the whole matter, but for ſome ſpeciall reaſons did forbeare. It laie by me almoſt a whole yeare, before I would reſolue ſo to do. At the length, for the ſatisfying of ſuch as might bee deſirous to bee ſatisfied in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
<pb facs="tcp:8782:6"/> and that fooliſh men might haue no further occaſion of their vaine imaginations and ſpeeches, I tooke it in hand as my great buſineſſe otherwiſe would permit, to peruſe it againe, and to adde ſome things for anſwere to Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, as touching ſome points for which the Anſw. referreth me to him, whoſe workes I had not at the firſt penning heereof, and ſo I haue preſumed, Chriſtian Reader, to offer it vnto thy conſideration. I haue termed the whole diſcourſe in reſpect of the principall purpoſe and argument of it, <hi>A Mirror of Popiſh ſubtilties,</hi> as wherein thou maiſt in part behold the vanitie &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe of thoſe anſweres wherein theſe men account ſo great ſubtiltie and acuteneſſe of wit and learning, as if the ſame being giuen, there were nothing more to be ſaide againſt them. In the publiſhing heereof, I haue thought good to obſerue this order. Firſt I haue ſet downe the aboue named places of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius.</hi> Secondly, M. <hi>Spence</hi> his Anſwere to thoſe two places. Thirdly, my reply to that anſwere. Fourthly, the latter anſwere to my reply, with a confutation thereof, from point to point, and a defenſe of the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations and authorities vſed in the ſaid reply. Reade all, and then iudge of the truth. I proteſt, I haue made conſcience to write nothing but the truth: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any vaine curioſitie led me to the publiſhing hereof, but only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of iuſtifying the truth, and that namely to thoſe of the Citie and Countie of <hi>VVorceſter,</hi> whom my labours do moſt neerely and properly concerne. If thou canſt reape any frute or benefit by it, I ſhalbe heartily glad thereof, and let vs both giue glorie vnto God.

Whence it is that the pretended Liturgies of S. <hi>Iames, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> are by the tranſlators tearmed by the name of Maſſe. Whereas thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, I doubt not, if they were written by thoſe men whoſe names they beare, as ſome of them aſſuredly were not, or if being written by them they remained as their Authors left them, as by the varietie of the editions of <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Liturgie it is plain they do not, would rather reſemble our communion wherein both the Miniſter and the people communicate togither in both kinds, then your Maſſe wherein the people are either idle lookers on, or when they are communicants, are by your ſacriledge communicants in one kinde onely, and ſecluded from the other; contrary altogither to the practiſe of the primitiue Church, or which is more, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe inſtitution of our Sauiour Chriſt.

And whereas you alledged to me that there was in them praier for the dead, there is good cauſe to thinke that thoſe praiers were at the firſt but commemorations and thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings for the departed in the faith of Chriſt; for that in <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Liturgie we finde, according to that which then I anſwered you, thus: <hi>We offer vnto thee, ô Lord, this reaſonable ſeruice for thoſe</hi>

Which vnion with Chriſt is wrought in all thoſe, and in thoſe only which do with true and liuely faith receiue theſe holie myſteries: where as that Capernaitiſh eating and drinking of Chriſts bodie and blood which your doctrine yéeldeth, is common to all graceleſſe and prophane perſons; that I ſay nothing of thoſe monſtrous, blaſphemous, and horrible conceits which ſome of your captaines haue fallen into by

               <p>But yet further you alleage the vniformeneſſe of the wordes of Chriſt in the Euangeliſts <hi>Mat. Mar. Luc.</hi> And in S. <hi>Paul, 1.

But they haue decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you, both in the on &amp; and in the other. For in the like matter you ſhall find in <hi>Moſes</hi> law by an vniforme and conſtant ſpéech, that the ſacrifices of the law are called <hi>expiations, propitiations and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſinne,</hi> which were not ſo indéed, but they were ſo called ſacramentally, becauſe they were types and figures, ſeales and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the true attonement which ſhould be wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheading of our Lord Ieſus. Again, if you had looked in S. <hi>Luke</hi> and<note place="margin">Luc 22. 20. 1. cor. 11. 25.</note> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> you ſhould haue found the words, <hi>This is my blood,</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch maner of ſpéech as tendeth directly to the ouerthrow of your tranſubſtantiation. For there it is ſaid; <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood, &amp;c</hi> where I hope you will not ſay, that the cup is tranſubſtantiated into the Teſtament, but that the wordes muſt be figuratiuely vnderſtood. Then you muſt ſay, that the cup, that is, the outward and viſible element of wine deliuered in the cup, is the ſeale of the new Teſtament &amp; couenant of grace, which is dedicated and eſtabliſhed by the bloodſheading of Ieſus Chriſt: by which ſeale we haue aſſurance offered vnto vs to be partakers through Chriſt of thoſe benefits which God hath promiſed vnto the faithfull in the ſame Teſtament; the ſumme whereof is ſet downe by the Prophet <hi>Ier, 31. 32, &amp;c.</hi> Now if any man ſhould take it thus:<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 32.</note>

                  <p>AS touching this firſt point of mixture of water with wine in the Sacrament, I ſhewed before that our Churches haue accounted it as a meere indifferent thing where it is vſed with that ſimplicitie wherwith it was firſt begun. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Countries where their wines are verie ſtrong, is to delaie them with water. Chriſtians would not neglect that commendable ſhew of ſobrietie in their myſticall banquet, whereof Heathen men had regard at their ordinary tables. Therefore according to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their countries they mingled water with their wine, taking wine to be the inſtitution of Chriſt, but whether méere wine or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied wine, they knew it made no difference. Albeit ſome there were that in regard of this ſobrietie and temperancie went too far, leauing Chriſtes inſtitution of wine, and vſing only water in the Sacrament, as <note n="a" place="margin">Cypr. lib. 2. epiſt. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> intimateth of ſome of his predeceſſours. To this mixture was added at length ſome ſignification, either in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time or perhaps before. As for that of <note n="b" place="margin">Epiſt. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. tomo. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the firſt to that purpoſe, that Epiſtle of his, and the reſt of them are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne to be counterfeit and baſtard ſtuffe. But thus this vſage and cuſtome ranne his courſe, till at length it ſell with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8782:21"/> reſt into the maine Ocean of Popiſh corruptions and ſuperſtitions, where the fathers errours were turned into peſtilent hereſies, and thoſe things that aroſe of the ſimplicitie of men for <note n="c" place="margin">Auguſt. epiſt. 119. ad exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem vitae melioris.</note> profitable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition and exhortation only as they intended them, were made matters of true deuotion and of the worſhip of God. Our Churches therefore ſéeing this mixture abuſed in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a neceſſary myſterie of Chriſtian religion without any warrant of the word of God, thought conuenient vtterly to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the ſame, though otherwiſe occaſion requiring it, they haue eſtéemed it an indifferent thing. And herein they haue followed the example of our Lorde and maiſter Ieſus Chriſt, who knew well inough that the waſhing of handes and cuppes was an indifferent thing, and yet when he ſaw <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 15. 2. &amp;c.</note> the Scribes and Phariſies to put af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of holineſſe &amp; puritie in thoſe waſhings, ſo that they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them vncleane which omitted the ſame, he did himſelfe neglect and by his example, as it ſéemeth, moued his diſciples to neglect that tradition of their Elders, telling them that in vaine they did worſhip God, teaching for doctrines the precepts of men.</p>

                     <hi>Why did Chriſt after his reſurrection drinke <hi>Not Water but VVine?</hi>
                     </hi> Where manifeſtly he nameth the drinking of wine and denieth water. To this he anſwereth: <hi>He would plucke vp by the rootes the pernicious hereſie of them which vſe Water in the Sacrament. For to ſhew that when he deliuered this Sacrament, he deliuered wine, therefore did he vſe wine alſo after his reſurrection at the bare table of the Sacrament. Of the fruite of the vine, ſaith he, which ſurely bringeth forth <hi>VVine and not VVater.</hi>
                     </hi> It is hard to ſuppoſe that <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> wold ſay, that Chriſt did drinke <hi>not water but wine,</hi> to reproue the hereſie of them which <hi>vſe water in the Sacrament,</hi> and yet himſelfe haue intention of both wine &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be vſed in the Sacrament. I cannot ſée it to ſtand with any reaſon. If the anſwere can, let him follow his owne fancie. As for the thing it ſelfe we doubt not, but the Churches of God haue vſed their libertie in the practiſe thereof, for that vppon occaſion of the hereſie of them that vſed onely water, they in ſome places tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this ceremony, as by the aforeſaid place of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> &amp; the practiſe of the Armenians may be gathered: in other places at leaſt altered the maner of it, that whereas it was wont to be added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſecration, thenceforth it ſhould be added after, that it might be knowne that water was no entire part or matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but vſed for other purpoſe indifferently, as hath bene before ſaide. The ground whereof <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> as we ſée maketh to be this, that Chriſt mentioneth only the fruite of the vine, which, ſaith he, <hi>bringeth forth wine and not water.</hi> Now this adding of water after conſecration, as it appeareth by the teſtimonie of <note n="p" place="margin">Ex Anſel. vt ſupra.</note>

To which what the church of <hi>Rome</hi> can honeſtly anſwere I cannot tell, in that ſhe hath by her detractions from Chriſtes inſtitution committed ſacriledge, and by her additions made a mockery of his Sacrament, ſetting the prieſt at the altar as a Squirrell at his bels
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8782:25"/> to kéepe note and time in his duckings and turnings, and kiſſings and croſſings, and liſting vp and lotting downe, and holding fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger and thumbe togither, and ioyning togither both the hands, and putting to the right eye and then to the left, and a number ſuch doltiſh and abſurd toyes.

And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the words that I alleaged before out of the Epiſtle <hi>ad Pompei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> are verie fit. Being vrged with tradition, he thus anſwereth: <note n="p" place="margin">cypria. epiſt. ad Pompeium.</note> 
                     <hi>Whence is this tradition? Deſcendeth it from the authoritie of the Lord, or of the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or commeth it from the precepts and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Apoſtles? For God teſtifieth that thoſe things which are written muſt be done. &amp;c. If therefore either it be commanded in the Goſpell, or be conteined in the Acts and Epiſtles of the Apoſtle, let this tradition be obſerued as holie;</hi> importing that if it cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued from thence, it is not to be obſerued. But the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ful wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clerk like, turneth the words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to ſpeake for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. <hi>If,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it be commanded in the Goſpell to vſe onely wine, let this tradition be obſerued.</hi> By which reaſon he giueth to the Armenians, whom he condemned before, as good a proofe for vſing water and oyle in Baptiſme, as to himſelfe for wine and water in the Lords ſupper. For they might haue ſaid for the one, as he doth for the other, that it is now here commanded to vſe onely water, and therefore that their adding of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yle was not to be condemned. But S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, if he wold vſe his reaſon to conceiue them, wold teach him to reaſon thus: We read in the Goſpel of water for Baptiſme; of oyle we reade nothing: therfore water only and not oyle is to be obſerued. So likewiſe we reade of wine for the Lords ſupper, of water we reade nothing: therefore wine onely and not water is to be enioyned. For the condition of the words of God is this: <note n="q" place="margin">Pro. 30. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Put nothing to his wordes leaſt he reproue thee, and thou be found a liar.</hi> Now if <hi>Cyprian</hi> hauing laid this good foundation built any thing amiſſe thereon, as in the matter of rebaptizing it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that he did, whileſt he tooke that to be the ſenſe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſcripture which indéed is not, that impeacheth not any whit the certaintie of that rule, which he knew well inough was alwaies to ſtand good for the triall and determination of the truth. And therefore in theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8782:25"/> caſes to alleage <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is I hope no more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a matter then to appeale from <hi>Philip</hi> ouercome with ſléepe, to the ſame <hi>Philip</hi> throughly a waked out of ſléepe. The drift and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of that Epiſtle to <hi>Cecilius,</hi> is to proue the neceſſitie of wine in the Sacrament, againſt the hereſie of thoſe that vſed onely water without wine. He referreth them herein to the inſtitution of Chriſt ſet downe in the Goſpell, from which he telleth them they ought not to depart, &amp; therefore that they ought to vſe wine in the Lords cup, as it is mentioned in the Goſpell that Chriſt did. And to this purpoſe are all thoſe ſpéeches which he vſeth of our Lords tradition, of his doing and teaching. Which manifeſtly appeareth as by the very ſcope of the whole Epiſtle, ſo by that place namely where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging the words of Chriſt, <hi>I will drinke no more of this fruite of the vine, &amp;c.</hi> He inferreth thus; <hi>Wherby we finde that the cup was mixed which the Lord offered, &amp;c.</hi> Yet we finde not in this place any mixture of the cup, we find only the fruite of the vine, and this is the marke at which he aimeth in all that he vrgeth of Chriſtes inſtitution. Of water he ſpeaketh ioyntly, I confeſſe, and ſuppoſing, I doubt not, but it was vſed by Chriſt. But he ſuppoſeth it only: he proueth it not, &amp; his ſuppoſe is no ſufficient warrant. Nay although he by the way admit and require the mixture of water in the Lords cuppe, yet ſéeing he there referreth vs to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But what meaneth the <hi>Anſw.</hi> to vrge <hi>Cyprian</hi> at all to prooue that Chriſt mingled water, when he himſelfe dare not vpon <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> word, affirme ſo much. For thus he maketh ſhort the matter as he ſaith: <hi>Wine is of the inſtitution of Chriſt, water is of the precept of the church.</hi> If he can iuſtifie no more, as indéed he cannot, it is but folly and trifling to alleage any mans words that ſay any more. And therfore all his other teſtimonies are ſuperfluous. They which ſay that Chriſt vſed water, ſay more then he or the moſt of his dare ſay. They which teſtifie the vſe thereof in the primitiue Church, proue a thing not denied or condemned where occaſion requireth it for ſuch reaſon and in ſuch maner as hath bene before ſhewed.

And ſo doth the <hi>Syriacke</hi> interpreter take it, tranſlating thus: <hi>As they had praied vnto the Lord.</hi> Secondly in that he ſaith that it cannot be vnderſtood of the miniſtery of the word or Sacraments, becauſe preaching and miniſtering of the Sacraments is to men and not to the Lord, he abuſeth his reader and his owne conſcience. For he knoweth well inough that although the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preach not to the Lord, nor miniſter the Sacraments to the Lord, but to men, yet in doing theſe duties vnto men, he miniſtreth vnto the Lord.

But the Ieſuit knew that it was a ſufficient anſwere to his argument, to ſay, that in preaching and miniſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to men, they might rightly be ſaid to miniſter vnto the Lord, becauſe they did it to the honor of the Lord, and in the ſeruice of the Lord.

He bringeth the Apoſtles wordes, but to what purpoſe? Doth the Apoſtle ſay, He that eateth, or he that eateth not to the Lord, doth therein miniſter vnto the Lord? Surely if in eatyng or not eatyng to the honour of the Lord, a man ſhall bée ſaide to miniſter vnto the Lorde, then in euery action that hee may doe, hee ſhall execute a function or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery to the Lorde, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith <note n="i" place="margin">1.

                  <p>Yet further let me tell him that if he will affirme the often offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſt, he muſt ſay alſo that Chriſt often ſuffereth and is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8782:41"/> ſlaine. For throughout the whole ſcripture he cannot alleage one place where the offering or ſacrificing of Chriſt is otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood then of his death and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this is plainly euicted out of the 9. to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt <note n="l" place="margin">He. 9. 25. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into heauen to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs, not to offer himſelfe often; for then,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſhould haue often ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world.</hi> Which reaſon of the Apoſtle hath no force at all if there be any other offering of Chriſt but only by ſuffering and death.

For ſacrifice, ſaith <note n="o" place="margin">Bellar. to 2. de Miſſa. lib. 1. ca. 2. 15. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> requireth a changing and conſuming, a killing &amp; deſtroying of the thing ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed; and a true and reall ſacrifice importeth a true and reall death or deſtruction of the thing that is offered in ſacrifice.

The Ieſuit hauing ſet downe theſe things in ſuch manner <note n="p" place="margin">cap. 27. vt ſupra.</note> as that he hath conuicted the Maſſe-prieſt to be a murtherer and deſtroyer of the bodie of Chriſt and paſſing ſlily ouer the matter with <hi>his omiſſis,</hi> ſetteth downe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward his ſuppoſe for the reſoluing of this doubt and auoyding of this hainous crime: but ſo as that it ſéemeth he was euen at his wits end to deuiſe a ſhift to ſalue the matter. He will haue conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8782:42"/> to belong to the eſſence of the ſacrifice, and it ſelfe to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing. But conſecration, I trow, importeth not a deſtroying of the body of Chriſt. Nay let him remember the old ſaying, <hi>Sacerdos eſt creator creatoris ſui: <hi>The prieſt is the maker of his maker.</hi>
                     </hi> And how but by conſecration? Then it ſhould ſéeme he doth not marre but make the body of Chriſt by conſecration, and therefore doth no ſacrifice therein. Yea but, ſaith he, by conſecration the body of Chriſt is ordeined to be truly and really deſtroyed. Not ſacrificed then by conſecration but ordeined to be ſacrificed. For the act of ſacrificing is the act of deſtroying the thing ſacrificed. For, as the <note n="q" place="margin">ibid.</note> Ieſuit ſaith, if the prieſt in the old law had receiued a ſhéepe for ſacrifice and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded ſo farre as to ſtrike the ſtroake for killing the ſhéep, yet if by any accident the ſtroake had bene hindered, it had bene no ſacrifice. And therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> as he ſaith againe, though he bounde his ſonne and laied him on the altar, and ſo ordeined him to be ſlain, yet for that he did not really kill his ſonne, did not really ſacrifice him but only in will. And therefore though conſecration be performed, yet there is no ſacrifice hitherto but only in purpoſe &amp; will, becauſe there is no chaunge or deſtroying of the thing to be ſacrificed. But yet further, how is the body of Chriſt ordeined by conſecration to be deſtroied? forſooth becauſe it therby receiueth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> condition of meate, and therefore is ordeined to be eaten, and conſequently to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and deſtroyed as we know it commeth to paſſe in meate. But where did he read that eating was an act of ſacrificing? Surely he himſelfe <note n="r" place="margin">cap. 2. vt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> reckoning all the formes and maners of the deſtroying of things ſacrificed in the old lawe, where many things ſacrificed were appointed to be eaten by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes, yet could not finde that eating was any part of ſacrificing, but defineth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying to haue bene either by killing as of liuing thinges, or by burning as of ſolide things without life; or by effuſion and powring out as of liquid or moyſt things. Then by his owne confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was not eating that did make the ſacrifice. And ſo much he <note n="ſ" place="margin">cap. 27.</note> confeſſeth here as touching the peoples eating. But why ſhould not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eating as well accompliſh the ſacrifice as the prieſts, ſéeing the body of Chriſt is as well deſtroyed by their eating as by his? Let it be anſwered with <hi>Nemoſcit.</hi> Again what ſacrifice ſhall we ſay was performed by Chriſt, ſéeing we do not reade in the Goſpell that he himſelfe did eate, but only gaue to his diſciples to eate? And if that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8782:42"/> muſt be ſuppoſed which he defendeth, that the ſacrifice was really and ſubſtantially Chriſt himſelfe, how may we be perſwaded that he did eate himſelfe, as he muſt néeds do if he did then ſacrifice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe, he being then the prieſt, it muſt be his eating y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> muſt make vp the ſacrifice? Moreouer what if it ſo fall out that neither the people nor the prieſt eate thereof, is there a ſacrifice or not? To ſay that there is, is contrary to his own definition of ſacrifice, which cannot be without deſtroying, and deſtroying here muſt be eating. To ſay, there is not, ouerthroweth his other poſition that ſacrifice is done in conſecration, as where he ſaith towards the end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <note n="t" place="margin">Apoſtoli co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrando ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificabant. Immolatio conſecratione perficitur.</note> 
                     <hi>the Apoſtles in conſecrating did ſacrifice,</hi> and out of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> that <hi>ſacrifice is performed by conſecration.</hi> And yet againe I maruell how it may be ſayd, that the body of Chriſt is truly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſtroyed in the prieſts eating thereof. Doth it verely go into his body as meate there to be altered and digeſted and chaunged in ſubſtance? No, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the body of Chriſt féeleth no hurt in it ſelfe, neither doth it looſe his naturall being, but only <hi>eſſe ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentale, <hi>his ſacramentall being.</hi>
                     </hi> But ſacramentall being is <hi>eſſe modi,</hi> not <hi>eſſe rei;</hi> a being touching the maner of the thing, not touching the thing it ſelfe. Now if there be a deſtroying only of the maner of the thing, not of the thing it ſelfe, then it cannot be ſayd that there is any ſacrifice done of the thing it ſelfe, becauſe ſacrifice importeth the deſtroying not of any maner or circumſtance, but of the thing it ſelfe that is ſacrificed. Otherwiſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> hauing bene bound &amp; laied vpon the altar in maner of a ſacrifice, though he were not indéede ſlaine, yet ſhall be ſaid to haue bene properly ſacrificed, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnbound and taken from thence he hath loſt that maner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein he was vpon the altar. It were abſurd to affirme this. Therfore it is abſurd alſo to affirme the other. In a word, a true and reall deſtroying of a thing, importeth more then a méere difference in circumſtance and reſpect. Séeing then that ſacrifice importeth a true and reall deſtroying of the thing ſacrificed, and that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any true &amp; reall deſtroying of the body of Chriſt in the Maſſe, except we will ſay he is there verely ſlaine, it followeth that vnleſſe we will ſay that Chriſt is verely ſlaine, there cannot be auouched any true and reall ſacrifice of the Maſſe. That the <hi>Anſw.</hi> will not graunt in any wiſe. Therefore conſequently he muſt forgo his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. The mad Ieſuit could not tell what to ſay to this point, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8782:43"/> yet was reſolued to ſay ſomewhat. He ſaw it faulty which his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes had ſet downe, and yet neither was hee able to reſolue the matter ſo but that he is ouerthrowne by his owne grounds. And therefore he ſpeaketh warely with <hi>Arbitror, <hi>I ſuppoſe,</hi>
                     </hi> as fearing leaſt he himſelfe ſhould be taken tardy. I maruaile that he béeing at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo néere the Pope the Oracle of the Church who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth without errour from his conſiſtory chaire, could not obtain of him the certaine and vndoubted trueth of this matter, but muſt thus féede men with his owne vaine gheſſes and ſuppoſals. The trueth is, neither the Pope himſelfe nor both his Seminaries of <hi>Rhemes</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> doe know what to determine of this point, and ſhould not we be wiſe men to beléeue them as touching a ſacrifice, of which they themſelues are not agréed how it is done or wherein it doth conſiſt?</p>
                  <p>But the nullity of this fained and counterfait ſacrifice I further ſhewed before by anſwering the obiection concerning the Fathers often ſpeech of ſacrifice. For I declared that they themſelues plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound themſelues not to meane any true &amp; reall ſacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, but onely a myſtery, a ſacrament, a reſemblance, a remembrance of a ſacrifice, as their owne wordes alleaged doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. To this he ſaith that thoſe teſtimonies doe prooue that there is a commemoration indéede of Chriſtes death and ſufferings, but not that they doe not in their ſacrifice really and indéede offer his body. Then he telleth me full wiſely what difference there is bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and them; that we ſay; there is a memory of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as being abſent; and they ſay; there is a memory of his <hi>one onely ſacrifice, that is, of his death.</hi> Herein he ſaith lieth the narrow iſſue to put a difference betwixt Chriſtes death and Chriſt himſelf, importing hereby that there is a remembrance of Chriſtes death in the Maſſe, and beſides that a true and reall offering of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. This he telleth me is the ſtate of the queſtion, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtart from and will not ſée. Where I may ſay of him as S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaid of the Hereticke: <note n="u" place="margin">Auguſt. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r. aduer. legis &amp; prophe. lib. 1. cap. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Quàm eleganter ſibi videtur iſte ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba diſcutere atque diſcernere, neſciens quid loquatur. <hi>How trimly doeth this man ſeeme to himſelfe to ſifte and diſcerne wordes and ſpeeches, and knoweth not what he ſaieth.</hi>
                     </hi> For firſt where he ſaith that <hi>their ſacrifice is onely to commemorate the death of Chriſt once paſt,</hi> hée croſſeth his owne aſſertion. For if they onely commemorate the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8782:43"/> death of Chriſt, then they doe not really offer him. If they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offer him, they doe not only commemorate his death. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſaith that there néedeth not now any newe oblation or ſacrifice for ſinne after Chriſtes death already paſt, becauſe his death is ſtill ſufficient and auaileable to take awaye ſinne, and yet hee addeth, that the ſame death of Chriſt giueth force and vertue to their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which they ſay is a ſacrifice propitiatory to take away ſinne. If there néede no other ſacrifice for ſinne after Chriſtes death, howe doeth his death giue force and vertue to their ſacrifice for ſinne? Belike hee woulde haue vs to vnderſtand, that their ſacrifice is but a méere fanſie and no ſacrifice in deede. Surely <hi>it is folly</hi> 
                     <note n="w" place="margin">Vigil. cont. Eutych. lib. 4.</note> as <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſaith. For a man <hi>to goe about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute that which withall hee is proued not to deny.</hi> Thirdly where he ſaith, that wee would haue the Sacrament a remembrance of Chriſt himſelf whereas they intend it of his death, he ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee too much delighted with idle talke. For if hee haue but common ſenſe he may vnderſtand by that that I ſaid vnto him, that we vſe the Sacrament entirely as a remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Chriſts death, and ſo defend it againſt their counterfaite and imagined reall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Fourthly he ſaith againe, we are commanded beſide the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Chriſtes death to offer the ſame death in a ſacrifice to God, and yet after he ſaith, it is onely to be recorded, figured and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.

                     </gap>ath and paſſion, there be in the Maſſe a true and reall offering or ſacrificing of the body and bloud of Chriſt. In which point we haue dalied mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailouſly all this while, and haue béene greatly too blame for going ſo wide from the queſtion propoſed. For the queſtion hath béene whether the body and bloud of Chriſt be verely and in déede offered or ſacrificed in the Maſſe, or not: and we haue ſtill very directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the body and bloud of Chriſt is not verily and indéed offered or ſacrificed in the Maſſe; that there is not any ſacrifice done for ſin in the Maſſe truely and properly ſo called: that the Maſſe is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable ſacriledge, and wicked profaning of the Sacrament of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8782:44"/> Chriſt. For firſt if they will defend a ſacrifice, they muſt defend it by the inſtitution of Chriſt. But let it bee reſolued what a ſacrifice is, and what is there in the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt that giueth ſo much as any ſhadow of a ſacrifice? <note n="y" place="margin">Bellar. tom. 2. de Miſſa. lib. 1. cap. 2.</note> To a true ſacrifice, ſaieth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and that truely, <hi>is required that that which is offered to God in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, be verily deſtroied, that is, be ſo changed as that it ceaſe to be (not onely in vſe but in ſubſtance) that that it was before.</hi> But what is there in the action of Chriſt anſwerable to this condition of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice? Is there any man ſo madde as to ſay that the body of Chriſt was there verily deſtroied? or is there any ſhew of any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? it is more then ſenſeleſſe to imagine it? Nowe it hath beene ſhewed before what a ſrurre the Ieſuit keepeth to vpholde the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſſe together with this definition, and yet all in vaine. Moreouer where may we haue it aſſured vnto vs that Chriſt did ſacrifice himſelfe twiſe? The Scripture preciſely telleth vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he offered himſelfe but once, which was by his death. <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 7. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>He needed not daily to offer vp ſacrifice, for that did he once when he offered vp himſelfe.</hi>

                     <note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 9. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>As it is appointed to men to die once: ſo Chriſt was once offered to take away the ſins of many.</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">cap. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>We are ſanctified by the offering of Chriſtes body once.</hi>

                     <hi>This man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing offered one ſacrifice for ſinne, ſitteth for euer at the right hande of God.</hi> This is all which the Scripture teſtifieth of the offering of Chriſt. Now if Chriſt did offer himſelfe but once, and that once was by death vpon his Croſſe, then it followeth that he did not offer himſelfe at the inſtitution of the Sacrament, and therefore commended not vnto vs any ſacrifice to be done therein. If they will ſay that he was but once offered in that manner, namely with bloudſhed, but vnbloudly he offered himſelfe beſide and ſo is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtill, they deale preſumptuouſly againſt the holy Ghoſt, and vſe that ſawcineſſe with the word of God, which no man may bee bold to doe with the lawes of men. For if it holde in the lawes of men that <note n="f" place="margin">Regula iuris. Non eſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguendum, vbi non diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguit lex.</note> 
                     <hi>no man may diſtinguiſh where the law it ſelfe doth not warrant his diſtinction,</hi> much more ought it to hold in the lawes and words of God. Now ſéeing the holy Ghoſt by a generall word compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all manner of offering hath determined the offering of Chriſtes body onely to once, who is he that dare giue checke vnto
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8782:44"/> his word, and ſay: It is a lie: for he was offered twiſe, once bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily on the Croſſe, another time vnblouddily in the Sacrament, &amp; ſo remaineth to be offered daily and infinite times in a day vnto the end of the world. Eſpecially ſéeing the Apoſtle vrgeth this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe for a great and maine difference betwixt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the old Teſtament, and the ſacrifice of the new, that the Prieſts there offered often, but <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 7. 27.

I tearme it iuſtly a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſpéech: For ſéeing they are forced by the euidence of the text to grant that the Apoſtle in that reſpect oppoſeth the ſacrifice &amp; prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt againſt the old ſacrifices &amp; prieſtood of the law, which oppoſition cannot ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d but only thus, that there were many prieſts, here but one: there often offering, here but once: what doe they but talke like drunken men they know not what, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the very ſame reſpect they confound the Prieſthood and ſacrifice of Chriſt with the Prieſthood and ſacrifices of the law, ſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8782:45"/> that as there were many prieſts, ſo here are many prieſts; as there was often offering, ſo is here alſo. He affirmeth indéede there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prieſts, here but one; there often offering, here but once; and therefore leaueth no place for any baſtard diſtinction of any manner whereby the body of Chriſt may be ſaide to be often offered. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore againſt this deuiſed manner wee are inſtructed by that which is written. <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Without ſhedding of bloud, there is no remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes.</hi> For hereof we gather that if the Maſſe be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne, then there muſt be ſhedding of bloud in the Maſſe. If there be ſhedding of bloud in the Maſſe, it is not an vnblouddy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and therefore the aſſertion of an vnblouddy ſacrifice in the Maſſe for the propitiation of ſinne is euidently contrary to the word of God. Now the bloud of Chriſt was ſhed for ſinne but only once, and that once vpon the Croſſe. Therefore Chriſt did offer himſelfe for ſinne but onely once and that vpon the Croſſe, and therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor doth offer himſelfe in the Sacrament. Againe when we read that <note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 9. 27. 28</note> 
                     <hi>as it is appointed vnto men to die once, ſo Chriſt was once offered to take away ſinnes:</hi> we are giuen to vnderſtand that as well it may be ſaide that men to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is appointed to die once may afterwards in another manner die oftentimes, as that Chriſt who is ſaide in the like ſort to be offered for ſinne but onely once, ſhould yet in another manner be offered for ſinne times without number, ſo long as the world ſtandeth. It is folly and madneſſe to ſay the one; it is madneſſe and blaſphemy to affyrme the other. And ſo much the more for that it is plainely teſtified vnto vs, that therefore hee néedeth not to be often offered becauſe <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>by one oblation he hath for euer made perfect them that are ſanctified.</hi> Which <hi>making perfect</hi> is declared in the words following to be intended <hi>of the forgiuenes of ſinnes.</hi> Now if Chriſt néede daily to be offered for the forgiuenes of ſinnes either generally or particularly or howſoeuer, then he did not by one oblation or offering of himſelfe make vs perfect in that behalfe. If he did perfectly worke remiſſion of ſinnes by one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of himſelfe, then he néedeth not thenceforth to bee offered for ſinne, and he that affirmeth the offering of him, doth fruſtrate his death and deny the perfection of his former offering. And therefore the Apoſtle inferreth as hath béene ſaide before, <note n="q" place="margin">ver. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Where remiſſion of ſinnes is, there is no more offering for ſinne:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: All ſacrifice for ſin is vaine after remiſſion of ſinnes once obtained,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8782:45"/> which is the end of ſacrifice for ſinne. Remiſſion of ſinnes is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought and obtained by the once offering of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe; therefore after the once offering of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, all offering or ſacrifice for ſinne is vaine, and therefore it is none at all. As for that which the <hi>Anſw.</hi> excepteth, that remiſſion of ſinnes doth come by Baptiſme, repentance, praier, &amp;c. And yet wée doe not thereby exclude Chriſtes death; intending thereby as it ſéemeth that it followeth not that Chriſtes death is excluded, though remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes be affirmed to be wrought by the ſacrifice of the Maſſe it is a friuolous and vaine ſhifte. For what compariſon is there betwixt the ſacrifice which it ſelfe is defended to be a propitiation for ſinne, and repentance, faith, praier, baptiſme, which doe not themſelues worke forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, but onely ſerue vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, wrought onely by the death and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedding of Ieſus Chriſt? As hunger prouoketh a man to deſire meate, ſo repentance ſtirreth him to ſéeke forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. As a man craueth meate to relieue his hunger, ſo praier craueth the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. As in a veſſell meate is ſet before a man and offered vnto him, ſo God in the word and Sacraments though in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort, ſetteth before vs and offereth vnto vs the effect of the bloud of Chriſt to the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. As the hande and mouth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the meate to the ſatisfying of hunger and comfort of the body, ſo faith receiueth the benefite of Chriſtes bloud to the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. But as neither the deſire of meate, nor the crauing for meate, nor the veſſell wherein meate is offered, nor the hand and mouth that receiueth the meate haue themſelues any vertue to féed the body, but the force thereof belongeth onely to the meate; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repentance, nor praier, nor the ſacraments, nor faith, haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertue themſelues of the remiſſion of ſinnes, but onely are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions of ſéeking, or meanes of offering and receiuing the death and paſſion of Chriſt, to which only and entirely in it ſelfe is to be attributed the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes. Neither is it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a fantaſticall toy which the <hi>Anſw.</hi> imagineth that theſe by an influence, as he ſpeaketh, of the paſſion of Chriſt haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the efficiency of the forgiueneſſe of ſins; in like maner (if at leaſt he will giue me leaue to expreſſe his minde by a compariſon) as the aire, being warmed by the fire, warmeth the body wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it is applied. A méere deuiſe of Satan that men whileſt they ſéek
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8782:46"/> for forgiueneſſe of ſinnes where it is not, may faile of it where it is, and whileſt they follow after a ſhadow by theſe deuiſes of influence from the bloud of Chriſt, may miſſe of the ſubſtance in Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe. The Scripture hath not taught vs that either our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or praiers, or faith, or ſacraments, are propitiations for our ſinnes, and therefore it is but a fonde ſhifte to gather from hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maintenance for the propitiatory ſacrifice of the Moſſe. I reſolue therefore as before that ſéeing Chriſt Ieſus by <hi>one offering hath perfected vs</hi> as touching the propitiation and attonement for our ſinnes, there is not now remaining any manner of offering what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer for propitiation of ſinne.</p>

                     <hi>a kinde of interceſſion to God in our behalfe, as if the fleſh it ſelfe did intreate God.</hi> Therefore our offering of Chriſt ſtandeth onely in this that by thoſe myſteries of his body and bloud which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for commemoration of his death, and by our faith and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we doe as it were preſent vnto God the Father, his ſonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God in that body wherein hée was crucified for vs, crauing for his ſake as thus crucified for vs y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> forgiueneſſe of all our ſinne.

                     <hi>to ſpeak good things</hi> for vs, and to intreate God that he will be mercifull vnto vs. And this vndoubtedly is the vtermoſt that the fathers meant in al thoſe ſpéeches of offering and ſacrifice wherewith the Papiſtes would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe vs. To be ſhort, the euidence of Scripture is againſt all ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne. They bring no euidence of Scripture for it. Some places indéede they alleadge, but in no other manner then the olde Heretickes were wont to alledge the ſcriptures for defence of their hereſies. There is nothing to be ſéene in the places themſelues to that purpoſe for which they are alleaged, but we muſt reſt onely vppon thoſe conſtructions and collections which it pleaſeth
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8782:47"/> them to make thereof. Againſt the euidence of ſcripture they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with a blinde diſtinction that hath no grounde from the holie Scripture, and that which is there generally denyed, they reſtraine without anye warrant to a particular manner. Chriſt is not to be offered after his once offering as the ſcripture teacheth. True, ſay they, not in that maner as he was once offered, but in another maner he may. We require it out of the ſcripture. Otherwiſe we may haue all aſſertions of faith and religion impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deluded. For with as great reaſon when we ſay there is but one God, it may be anſwered that in that maner as he is God there is but one, but in another maner there are many: when we ſaie there is but one redéemer, it may be anſwered that in that maner as he is redéemer, there is but one, but in another maner, there be many: nay when it is ſayd, that Chriſt died but once, as it is ſayd he was offered but once, why may it not as wel be ſaid, that in that maner as he died once, he dieth no more, but in another maner he dieth often, as that he is offered no more indéed in that maner as he was offered before, but in another maner he is offered often. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this licentious and preſumed diſtinction is ioyned with impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie againſt God, and ſerueth to giue a mocke to all the wordes of God, and for this cauſe is to be deteſted of vs, beſide that it is, as hath bene before ſhewed, manifeſtly contradicted by the word of God. Much more might here be added, to ſhew the villany and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. But it ſhall ſuffice for my purpoſe to haue added this to that that I had ſayd before; where notwithſtanding this matter was manifeſtly inough declared to ſatiſfie the <hi>Anſw.</hi> had he bene as carefull to know the truth, as he is wilfull to continue in his errour.

And ſéeing the Fathers ſpeaking of their offering of Chriſt, do recall and correct thoſe termes as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ſpoken, and put in place thereof that they rather <hi>celebrate the remembrance of his ſacrifice, as if he were now ſacrificed indeed,</hi> we conclude hereof, neither can the <hi>Anſw.</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oyd it, that they ſimply deny the true and reall offering of the bodie of Chriſt, as before is the wed. Secondly, he ſaith that I wrangle in interpreting <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> here in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe places to be the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> whereas it is meant of the offring of the ſame in a ſacrifice. But indéed he ſaith he knoweth not what. For immediately before he expoundeth <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in theſe places to be meant of the death of Chriſt, and how commeth it to paſſe now that it muſt be vnderſtood of offering the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in a ſacrifice? But if his pen ſlipped, and he put in (theſe places) meaning it of others, where I ſay the Fathers call the Euchariſt a ſacrifice, that which he ſaith is but <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> and a begging of that to be yéelded for truth, which I haue auowed and proued to be falſe, The <hi>Euchariſt</hi> I vnderſtande to bee the celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with thankeful remembrance of the death of Chriſt. This I ſay the Fathers doe often call <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> becauſe the matter thereof is the ſacrifice of Chriſtes death, not becauſe Chriſt is therein ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſacrificed. Thirdly I wrangle forſooth againe in bearing him in hand that the authorities alleaged do meane the thing repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Chriſtes body, whereas they vnderſtand it to be Chriſtes paſſion, and death vpon the Croſſe. Where without doubt eyther the <hi>Anſw.</hi> wits or his honeſty failed him very much. For he would haue it ſeem that we intend not by the places of the fathers a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting of Chriſtes paſſion and death, but méerely of his body, and yet he himſelfe iuſtifieth the contrary ſtraight waies after. For within ſome fewe lines he alleageth my wordes directed to thoſe places of the fathers, that the death and paſſion of Chriſt is the whole matter and ſubſtance of this myſtery. To which I added al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diuers more wordes to that purpoſe, concluding that nothing is here remembred, but Chriſtes ſacrificing himſelfe vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croſſe. For although we ſay that we repreſent the body and bloud of Chriſt whereof yet there was nothing ſpoken in this place, yet as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I tolde him, we repreſent the body no otherwiſe but as bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8782:51"/> and the bloud no otherwiſe but as ſhed for vs. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here, though hauing not ſo much as a ſillable whereto he may referre this ſpéech, he telleth me that I wrangle in pretending the thing repreſented to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Chriſt, wheras it is his death and paſſion; as if I excluded the repreſentation of Chriſtes death and paſſion, which by his own confeſſion I make the whole matter and purport of the Sacrament. But this draffe he thought good enough, wherewith to féede his corner companions, and to perſwade them that he had dealt very acutely and wittely in anſwering that that had béene ſaide vnto him.</p>
                  <p>He telleth me again that I ouer-reach in ſaying that the death and paſſion of Chriſt is the whole ſubſtance of this myſtery. Hée ſhoulde haue ſaide that I come ſhort, becauſe I ſay not ſo much as he would haue me to ſay. For, ſaith he, there are two thinges in our ſacrifice; a myſticall offering of the paſſion of Chriſt, and a real offering of the body of Chriſt. But neither ſcripture nor father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commended to our practiſe any other ſacrifice of Chriſt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the myſticall offering of his paſſion. Neither doe any of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the fathers ſo much toſſed and tumbled by the Papiſts enforce any other, as I alleaged the laſt time, and the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſaieth nothing to diſprooue it. Surely wonder it is, if the matter were ſo cleare as theſe men would perſwade vs, that neuer any one of the fathers ſpeaking ſo often of the ſacrifice would once note this point expreſſely and diſtinctly that they had both a myſticall offering of the paſſion of Chriſt and a reall offering of his body beſides: no not when the maine drifte of their ſpéech preſſed them ſo to doe, if they had beléeued any ſuch thing. But they knew it not at all, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruaile that they ſaied nothing of it. For where as the <hi>Anſw.</hi> telleth me that the Fathers giue reaſons why it is a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice indéede, namely becauſe the bloudy ſacrifice of the croſſe &amp; death of Chriſt is offered and ſacrificed in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What reaſon then ſo much to force it in the other? Nay becauſe they teach vs that the paſſion &amp; death of Chriſt is the ſacrifice which we offer, and the paſſion of Chriſt is here to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>not in the truth of the thing, but in a ſignifying myſterie,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeaketh, it foloweth that the ſacrifice which we offer, as touching y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> preſent act muſt be vnderſtood a ſacrifice <hi>not in the truth of the thing but in a ſignifying myſterie.</hi> But here the <hi>Anſw.</hi> would ſaine lift me vp before I am downe, telling me firſt that mine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is againſt art, becauſe the forme is negatiue in the third figure. But the man without doubt hath forgotten his Logicke.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8782:52"/> For what propoſition of all theſe is negatiue, I maruell? Mary this forſooth: <hi>The</hi> paſſion of Chriſt is here to be vnderſtood <hi>not in the truth of the thing but in a ſignifying myſterie,</hi> and ſo the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But if I ſhould ſay to him that <hi>Campian</hi> and his fellows were executed not for religion but for treaſon, would he not take it that I ſpake verie affirmatiuely that they were executed only for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

But this being made good, the <hi>Maior</hi> or firſt propoſition he ſaith is falſe, if I meane it as I muſt, that the paſſion of Chriſt is the whole ſacrifice.

For the multitude of the ſacrifices of the law is taken away. One is appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ende of the world, once offered for the aboliſhing of ſinne.

                     <hi>There is now no more offering for ſinne.

Therefore we need not daily to purge with daily ſacrifices as in the old law.</hi> If we néed not daily to purge with daily ſacrifice as they did in the olde law, then ſurely the daily ſacrifice of the Maſſe is ſuperfluous, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no ſacrifice at all. By theſe and ſundry other teſtimonies of the old Fathers, it is euident and cleare inough to thoſe that will ſée, that they knew not nor were acquainted with this ſtrange deuiſe of a continuall reall offering of the body of Chriſt.

We know that the Papiſts come née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to thoſe rites and ceremonies wherewith the Heathens &amp; Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims haue worſhipped their idol gods, then is conuenient for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to do in the ſpirituall ſeruice of the true God. And yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that they eſtabliſh thoſe profane myſteries or opinions whereunto the ſame ceremonies were annexed. So might <hi>Caluin</hi> truly ſay, that the Fathers in ceremonies came too néer the Iewes, and yet be farre, as indéed he was, from denying that they taught or eſtabliſhed any reall ſacrifice in the church. In a word, <hi>Caluin</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth not the Fathers of Iudaiſme, but Papiſts of peruerſneſſe and wickedneſſe in abuſing the writings of the Fathers.

For ſetting that downe which <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith that <note n="q" place="margin">Cypr. lib. 2. epiſt. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>the paſſion of Chriſt is the ſacrifice which wee offer,</hi> what termes of ſacrifice can they alleage out of the Fathers which do not agrée to the paſſion of Chriſt? It is the killing of the lambe of God, the ſacrifice of ſacrifices, the euerlaſting quickening ſacrifice, the ſacrifice of our Mediator, the ſacrifice of our price, the eternall redemption both of body and ſoule. Now ſith the paſſion of Chriſt is not now really performed, the ſacrifice to which theſe ſpéeches are applied, is not a ſacrifice now really done, but only in a myſterie and by remembrance. Now although it be plaine inough by that that hath bene already ſaid, that there is no ſuch ſacrifice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed as the <hi>Anſw.</hi> and his company do affirme, yet ſuppoſing for the while that there is, let vs ſée what he will make of it, or to what vſe he will put it. The vſe of it, as he telleth me in the former ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to apply vnto vs remiſſion of ſinnes, purchaſed by the death of Chriſt only. By which words he ſpoyleth his Maſſe of the nature of a propitiatory ſacrifice. For the true propitiatory ſacrifice euen by the very ſignification of the word, is that only which it ſelfe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfieth for ſinne, and purchaſeth by the vertue and force thereof, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes and attonement with God. Now therfore if for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes be purchaſed by the death of Chriſt onely, then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8782:54"/> it ſtandeth not with the Maſſe to be a propitiatorie ſacrifice.

Otherwiſe it were inough for a man whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is dead to haue one only Maſſe,</hi> which in no caſe is tollerable to thinke. Now therefore it is good for a man to haue Maſſe vpon Maſſe, and neuer leaue maſſing, &amp; for his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he muſt remember paying, and yet when he hath all done, he is no whit the néere; for after he is dead, he muſt yet haue more maſſing to helpe his ſoule to heauen, and thereof he muſt bethinke himſelfe when he maketh his will. Theſe horrible and curſed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are conteined in the Roomiſh ſacrifice, wherby they haue made a mockery of the ſonne of God, and troden vnder their féete as a vile and baſe thing the ſacred blood of Chriſt whereby we were redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But ſéeing that the applying of Chriſts death conſiſteth not in ſacrificing, with what reaſon do theſe men teach a ſacrifice to apply the death of Chriſt vnto vs? Why could they not as well without any new ſacrifice make the prieſtes <hi>Memento</hi> and his intention a meanes to apply Chriſtes death vnto vs, as giue him power to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Chriſt againe, and to apply that ſacrifice to whom he will, and by that to apply the other ſacrifice of his death? And what if the prieſt neuer ſo much as thinke vpon Chriſts death in his Maſſe, but mumble it vp without conſideration thereof, how ſhall we thinke that he doth apply the death of Chriſt? Laſt of all, why may they not with as good reaſon ſay, that Chriſt muſt be borne againe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply vnto vs the benefit of his birth: that he muſt ſuffer, die and riſe againe, to apply vnto vs the vertue of his paſſion, death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as that he muſt be ſacrificed againe to apply vnto vs the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit

The truth of applying, as the verie word ſheweth, conſiſteth in offering and giuing of Chriſt vnto vs, and our receiuing of him.

You are wide and go aſtraie far from the ſtate of that queſtion; I ſay no more, but view our queſtions therein. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> &amp; <hi>Gelaſius</hi> are anſwered at large, whatſoeuer they thought they were far from your minde. <hi>Theodoret</hi> at that time was ſo partiall, as in the controuerſie betweene him and <hi>Cyrill</hi> it appeareth, that he was faine to recant ere he could bee reconciled. And in theſe verie Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues we can ſhew you errors, yea foule of his. It is not vnlikely that hee followed ſometimes the counſell that himſelfe in the ſame Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues giueth, that is, to make a crooked wand ſtraight, to bend it as much the other way. And now ſir to come to <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> who in euerie point accordeth with <hi>Theodoret</hi> againſt the Eutychian hereſie, firſt he writeth thus: <hi>Sapientia aedificauit ſibi domum ſeptiformis ſpiritus ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate ſubnixam,</hi> &amp;c. I will Engliſh it, for the ſame cauſe. Thus it is: Wiſedome <hi>that is Christ the wiſedome of the father,</hi> hath builded for it ſelfe an houſe grounded or leaning vpon the ſoundneſſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth fold ſpirit, which ſhould miniſter the foode or nouriſhment of Chriſts incarnation, whereby or by which foode, we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the diuine nature. Verily the Sacraments of the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt which we receiue, are a diuine thing, for the which cauſe by the ſame alſo, are we made partners of the diuine nature, and yet the ſubſtance or nature of bread, and wine ceaſeth not to be, (<hi>or looſeth not his being vtterly, and is anihilated and becommeth nothing</hi>) and certes in the action (or celebration) of the myſteries, (<hi>or Sacraments</hi>) an image or ſimilitude (<hi>or reſemblance</hi>) of Chriſts bodie and blood is celebrated
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8782:57"/> (<hi>or practiſed.</hi>) It is therefore euident inough ſhewed vnto vs, that we ought to thinke the ſame thing to bee in Chriſt our Lorde himſelfe, which we profeſſe to be, which we celebrate, and which we receiue in his image: (<hi>he meaneth in the Sacrament</hi>) that euen as they, (<hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of bread and wine</hi>) by the working of the holie Ghoſt do paſſe ouer, (<hi>or be chaunged</hi>) into a diuine ſubſtance, remaining neuertheleſſe in the propertie of their nature, right ſo do they ſhew, that that verie principall myſterie it ſelfe: (<hi>by which he meaneth Christ, God, &amp; man: now being in two natures, one perſon in heauen whom the hereticke Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches would haue in heauen to haue loſt his manhood, and to be but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi>) whoſe efficiencie (or perfect nature) and vertue they (<hi>the ſayd Sacraments</hi>) do truly repreſent, the things whereof it properly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth (<hi>it is the two natures of the diuinitie and humanitie in one perſon</hi>) ſtill remaining, doth remaine and continue one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt (<hi>becauſe he is whole and truly being, or conſiſting in his whole and true natures of God and man in one perſon.</hi>) This teſtimony of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> might ſeeme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to make ſomewhat for a Lutheran, becauſe it ſeemeth to affirme in the B. Sacrament to be two ſubſtances, a diuine ſubſtance, &amp; bread and wine: but the Caluiniſt lacketh foure of his fiue wits to vrge it, which maketh flat againſt him, not only in the verie words, but moſt chiefly in the drift of the argument againſt <hi>Eutyches,</hi> which by the conſideration <note n="c" place="margin">His circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſerue only to blinde the eies of the reader. The troubling of the riuer is for the aduantage of the fiſher.</note> of the circumſtances following, ſhall moſt euidently appeare: for that the verie words &amp; force of the reaſon or argument, here made, do proue Chriſts bodie to be really preſent, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth. <hi>Eutyches</hi> the Abbot, who was condemned in the Chalcedon Councell, at which time <hi>Gelaſius</hi> flouriſhed, held that our Sauiour Chriſt his deitie or diuine nature, after his aſcenſion into heauen, did <note n="d" place="margin">As touching the ſubſtance not as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: euen as the Papiſts ſay of the bread &amp; wine.</note> conſume and anihilate or bring to nothing his humane nature: So that by his hereſie Chriſt now ſhuld be no more man but God alone. The truth of the B. Sacrament, that therein Chriſt was really continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was ſo commonly and firmely beleeued and profeſſed in the holie church, <note n="e" place="margin">That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neuer any Father taught it, the Anſwerer is driuen to ſeeke proofe thereof from the heretickes</note> that there were diuerſe heretickes that vſed, (or rather abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) the ſame for an argument pretenſedly to confirme their hereſies. The Maniches to proue that the ill god (ſuch was their blaſphemous hereſie) had impriſoned certaine parcels or peeces of the good God in theſe worldly creatures &amp; earthly things, alleaged Chriſt (whom they<note place="margin">f Vntruth. S. Auſten doth not graunt it.</note> called the good God) to be really in the Sacrament, but S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> graunting them Chriſt to be really therein ſaith hee, is there <hi>by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8782:58"/> not by creation:</hi> or as it were impriſoned. So touching our caſe of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> the <hi>Eutychian</hi> againſt whom he wrote, held Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his humanitie being gone, to be only God in like maner as his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature only is in the Sacrament, the bread and wine being anihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and conſumed vnto nothing: <note n="g" place="margin">A leaud tale wholy deuiſed of the Anſw. himſelfe. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches neuer imagined any ſuch matter, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</note> nothing therein remaining of the ſubſtantiall properties or natures of bread and wine, but onely Chriſts diuine nature. So certaine a veritie it was then currant in the whole church, and to the verie heretickes that Chriſt is really in the B. Sacrament. Whereupon by a ſimilitude or reſemblance taken from the Sacrament, he wold haue nothing remaining in heauen of Chriſts humanitie: but the ſame being vaniſhed into nothing, his Deitie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there to remain, as the bread is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed in the Sacrament. Againſt this ſimilitude <hi>Gelaſius</hi> replieth, not denying Chriſts bodie &amp; diuine nature to be really in the Sacrament, which was and euer hath bene a generall, currant, and confeſſed truth: which otherwiſe had ſerued his turne much better to deny, and thereby had he more readily and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reiected and reprooued the argument framed againſt him by that ſimilitude. But confeſſing that the Sacraments of bread &amp; wine, do paſſe ouer and be turned into a diuine ſubſtance, thereby granting a reall preſence of Chriſt God and man, and in effect tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: only he denieth the bread to be anihilated or become nothing, or as he termeth it <hi>deſinere eſſe,</hi> to ceaſe from hauing any being at all. Before <hi>Berengarius</hi> neuer any man held that <note n="h" place="margin">Vntruth: for all the Fathers held the ſame, as ſhall appear by many of them in that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> Chriſts bodie was not really in the Sacrament, nor that the whole ſubſtance of bread and wine vnchaunged, were in the Sacrament either without anie other ſubſtance, as <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> holde, or ioyned togither with Chriſts bodie by impanacion as <hi>Luther</hi> held: but that the bread and wine by a conuerſion were made Chriſts bodie &amp; blood, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion in the church of God in the greateſt Councell that euer was held, called the Laterane Councell, where occaſion was offered of the full ſearch of the matter by <hi>Berengarius</hi> hereſie, by the inſtinct <note n="i" place="margin">Not of the holie Ghoſt but of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sathan to bring in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8782:58"/> or accidentall properties, but alſo the naturall properties, namely as he there ſpeaketh</hi> panietas, <hi>breadineſſe to driue away hunger, and</hi> vineitas <hi>winineſſe to driue away thirst, and the force or nature of nouriſhing.</hi> So that this turning of the bread and wine into Chriſts bodie, was not anihilation or vtter vaniſhing of the bread as <hi>Gelaſius</hi> denieth: not a naturall change as is wrought in naturall conuerſions, where the ſame matter remaining vnder both formes, only the firſt forme is changed into an other forme, I meane not <hi>forma accidentalis,</hi> but <hi>forma eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialis,</hi> by which things they haue their being and ſubſtance: neither change of the matter that is vnder the eſſentiall forme, the ſaid eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall forme remaining: but in this wonderfull ſacrifice, is a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and miraculous change of both the matter, and eſſentiall forme of bread into the whole ſubſtance of Chriſts bodie. And that was ſo eſtabliſhed leaſt by ioyning either the matter or the eſſentiall forme of bread with Chriſts bodie, they ſhould graunt <note n="k" place="margin">A waightie conſideration verily, and fit for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſuch graue Fathers</note>

The ſecond thing which to anſwere and ſtop the quarrelling hereticke, he addeth, is, that the ſubſtance of bread and wine do not ceaſe to be, that is to ſay, doth not vtterly periſh into nothing, but remaineth vnder the chaunge, which word <hi>Subſtance</hi> he mollifieth and interpreteth by adding <hi>or nature of bread,</hi> and by and by after, he calleth it <hi>the propertie of the nature of bread,</hi> where the heretickes for <hi>or,</hi> which is a word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the former, haue foyſted in <hi>ſubſtance and nature of bread.</hi> So that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> meant not that the whole ſubſtance of bread remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the Sacrament, but that, not only the accidentall properties,

And therfore thus much is to be noted, that the force of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon between Chriſts being in heauen, &amp; in the bleſſed Sacrament is not in this point, that in heauen he is in both ſubſtance of manhood, and Godhead, euen as in the Sacrament are two whole ſubſtances, Chriſts body &amp; the whole ſubſtance of bread and wine. But the ſimilitude is herein, that as in the diuine Sacrament, with the verie true bodie of Chriſt which <hi>Gelaſius</hi> calleth a <hi>diuine ſubſtance,</hi> there are conioyned eſſentiall, ſubſtantiall, and naturall properties of bread and wine: Euen ſo in heauen Chriſt in one perſon hath vnited all the naturall, and eſſentiall properties of his two natures, the Godhead, and the manhood, vnconfounded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable, whole and diſtinct: which is as much as out of the heretickes obiection of the Sacrament, he needed to reply or vrge againſt him at that time, and vpon that occaſion.

He taketh exception againſt this <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> that he was not Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then though he were, yet all that he wrote was not of authority, becauſe he did not pronounce it from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory chaire. &amp;c. Thirdly whatſoeuer he thought, he was farre from our mind. Againe <hi>Theodoret</hi> was not of ſound iudgement: he had foule errors: and to make a crooked wand ſtraight, he did bend it too much the other way: that is, to confound <hi>Eutyches</hi> his hereſie, he did plainely and flatly deny popiſhe tranſſubſtantiation. But all theſe ſhifts the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> in his owne conſcience knewe to be vaine and friuolous. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> after that he was Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> wrote fiue bookes againſt <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> The treatiſe whence I tooke thoſe words that I alleadged, goeth vnder his name as a part of one of thoſe bookes. Thus I finde it repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and no proofe giuen to diſprooue it. In the end of this treatiſe, he exhorteth them to whom he writeth that as <hi>they did with one mind hold the Apoſtolike ſea, ſo they ſhould conſtantly auouch that rule of Catholicke faith</hi> which he had declared out of the writinges of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fathers that were before him, making their holding with the Apoſtolicke ſea, a reaſon why they ſhould giue héede to that which he had written. Which may giue a good coniecture that it was <hi>Galaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no other <hi>Gelaſius</hi> that was the author of this booke.

Now there were alſo of <hi>Eutiches</hi> his faction, who being conuicted of the abſurdity of this opinion, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the vaniſhing and conſuming of the nature of his manhood to the time of his aſcenſion, of whom I ſhall ſpeake afterward. But in the meane time, let the <hi>Anſw.</hi> here thinke whether I ſaid rightly the laſt time, that <hi>Eutyches</hi> if he were now aliue, would ſurely be a Papiſt. The abſurd conceit of Tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſerueth fit for his purpoſe, and if it had bene in his time beléeued, he would haue ſaid: Do ye not ſée that after conſecration there remaineth the colour, and ſhewe, and appearance of bread &amp; wine, but yet there is not the ſubſtance of them; for the ſubſtance is quite aboliſhed by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Right ſo after the vniting of the two natures of Chriſt, the ſubſtance of the humane nature is quite conſumed, though there appeare the facion and ſhape and likeneſſe, yea and the doings and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8782:61"/> ſufferings of a man. This he would haue alleaged for colour of that ſhadow and phantaſie of Chriſts humanitie which he defended here vpon the earth. But this ſtood not with the doctrine of that time. Nay, whereas <hi>Eutyches</hi> could not vnderſtand that thoſe thinges which were done &amp; performed properly in the manhood, are rightly ſaid to haue bene done and performed by God, by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall vniting of the manhood vnto the Godhead, but would for the iuſtifying of this ſpeech aboliſh the manhood, and bring in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head into the emptie facion and ſhape of a man (euen as the Papiſts to make good the ſpéeches that are vſed oftentimes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrament to expreſſe the ſingular effect thereof, do thruſt out the ſubſtance of bread and wine, and bring the very ſubſtance of Chriſts bodie and blood into the emptie formes and ſhewes of the ſame) <hi>Gelaſius</hi> by a compariſon taken from the Sacrament according to the doctrine of his time, ſheweth him the vanitie of his opinion. He ſetteth downe to that purpoſe theſe two grounds, firſt that the Sacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is an image or reſemblance of the body and blood of Chriſt, and therefore ſecondly, that we muſt beléeue and profeſſe the ſame of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that we do of his image. Which both tend to this concluſion, that as the Sacrament is a diuine and heauenly thing of excellent grace and vertue, ſo that by it we are made partakers of the diuine nature, and yet there ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance of bread &amp; wine: ſo Chriſt as touching his manhood is aduanced to moſt high excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and maieſtie, by the vniting thereof vnto the Godhead into one perſon, ſo that as man he is honoured &amp; adored of all creatures, and all knées muſt bow vnto him, and whatſoeuer was done or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Chriſt as man, is ſayd to haue bene done and ſuffered by God, and yet there ceaſeth not to be in him the very true ſubſtance and nature of man. <note n="z" place="margin">Gelaſ. cont.

This collection togither with the places of <hi>Auſten</hi> and <hi>Ireneus</hi> I ſet downe before, ſufficiently prouing the falſhood of Tranſubſtantiation. But the <hi>Anſw.</hi> thought good to paſſe it ouer without any mention, becauſe he could not finde any anſwere at all to it, which ſerueth not for the maintenance of <hi>Eutyches</hi> his hereſie; as do all thoſe ſhifts and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions whereby he goeth about to darken the euidence and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his words. Let vs ſée now what good ſtuffe there is conteined in them. In his firſt and fourth circumſtances, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth either his ignorance or elſe his partialitie and falſhood. For taking in hand by way of circumſtance to ſet downe the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> where he ſhould haue done it wholly &amp; faithfully, he doth it but in part and deceitfully, that it may not ſéem to make ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt his breadleſſe bread. For he reſtraineth it only to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time after Chriſts aſcenſion, as if <hi>Eutyches</hi> had thought that the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Chriſt was not conſumed till after the time that he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. Whereas <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in the very next words to the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged, giueth plainly to vnderſtand that <hi>Eutyches</hi> meant the aboliſhing of the ſubſtance of the manhood euen while Chriſt was on the earth, though he reteined the ſhew and aprearance of man, yea and continued paſſible alſo, by reaſon whereof, he ſayd his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head ſuffered and was crucified, which ſuffering was the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall propertie of the humane nature. For <hi>Eutyches</hi> held not the annihilating of the properties of the manhood, as the <hi>Anſw.</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ounding of them with the properties of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Godhead by thoſe properties did &amp; ſuffered thoſe things which belonged to the manhood. And this appeareth plainly in the definition of the Chalcedon Councell, where it is thus ſayd: <note n="d" place="margin">Concil. chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Act. 5. in definit.</note> 
                     <hi>They fondly imagine that there is but one nature of the Godhead and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8782:63"/> fleſh, and ſo by a monſtrous confuſion of Chriſt, they ſignifie that the diuine nature or Godhead is paſſible and ſubiect to ſuffering.</hi> So that <hi>Eutyches</hi> held the ſame of Chriſt on the earth, as the Papiſts do of the bread in the Sacrament, that there was the ſhewe and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of man, and the properties of the manhood remaining, but the ſubſtance was conſumed: euen as theſe do hold that there is in the Sacrament a ſhew of bread, and the properties of bread remaining, but the ſubſtance of the bread is vaniſhed. How then ſhuld <hi>Gelaſius</hi> go about to refute the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches</hi> by the Sacrament, if his opinion as touching the Sacrament had bene the ſame that the Papiſts now is. Againe whereas he ſaith that <hi>Eutyches</hi> held that the bread was vtterly annihilated, nothing remaining therin of the ſubſtantiall properties or natures thereof, he deſerueth the iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a falſe &amp; vnſhame faſt perſon. For what a peruerſe and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man is he to deuiſe ſuch a matter of his owne braines, for proofe or likelihood wherof, there is not ſo much as any ſhew to be found in any auncient writer. <hi>Eutyches</hi> forſooth held that <hi>panietas &amp; vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the Papiſtes reall preſence, iumpeth with the Manichées im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning of Chriſt; for they make Chriſt ſo faſt bound by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the formes of bread and wine, that though ratts or miſe or ſwine eate the ſame, or though it lie in the mire, yet it muſt not be thought but that the body of Chriſt is there ſtil, euen till the formes be conſumed, and to thinke otherwiſe, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſaith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogateth from the truth of the ſacrament, as after ſhalbe declared.</p>
                  <p>To his ſixt circumſtance I anſwere him that the Lateran coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was the aſſembly of Gog and Magog, to ſet the idoll <hi>Mauzim</hi> in his place.

                  <p>The ninth circumſtance telleth vs honeſtly, that before the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane councell, it was no hereſy not to iumpe with Tranſſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. And then belike a man might haue beene a Caluiniſt in that point, as all the Fathers were, and yet not to be accounted an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke. At leaſt he might haue ſaid that the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of bread &amp; wine did remaine in part, but not wholly forſooth; as perhappes ſaith the <hi>Anſw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> ſome of the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and namely <hi>Gelaſius</hi> thought: a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and childiſh fancy. When we ſhew them plainely out of the Fathers that the ſubſtances of bread and wine remaine in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, forſooth the Fathers thought that the ſubſtances of bread and wine, remaine in part but not wholly. What conſcience may we thinke theſe men make of their anſwers? Why doth he not bring ſomewhat out of the Fathers, to approoue this fond ſophiſtication &amp; vnhandſome dreame? But it muſt be enough for vs, that the <hi>Anſw.</hi> telleth vs that ſo it is.</p>
                  <p>But it is worth the noting that he telleth vs, that it was not clearely defined before the Lateran councell, what maner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>kept nothing back, but declared all the councell of God,</hi> kéepe backe this? or did he deliuer it to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and not deliuer it to the <hi>Romaines</hi> &amp; other churches? To ſay the Apoſtles did not clearely know it, is to make himſelfe wiſer then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. To ſay they knew it but declared it not, is to make them vnfaithful in their charge. To ſay that the church receiued it cléere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered, and yet that it was neuer cléerely defined, vntill the Lateran councell, is a contradiction, and impugneth that in the one part which is ſet downe in the other. To ſay the church, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the church of <hi>Rome</hi> receiued it, and did afterwardes forgoe it, is to make the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a very bad kéeper of the doctrines of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8782:65"/> the Apoſtles, eſpecially ſéeing the ſacrament is a matter of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and daily vſe. But indéed we take that which he ſaith for true, that Tranſſubſtantiation was neuer cléerely defined, before the Lateran councel. But we tell him withall, that we are very dein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to admit that for a doctrine of truth, which for a thouſand yeares and more after Chriſt, was neuer cleerly knowen or defined in the church of God. And becauſe it was no hereſy all that while, not to iumpe with Tranſſubſtantiation, we are well aſſured that it is no hereſy to leape from it now.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne to <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> the <hi>Anſw.</hi> findeth an hole or two in his wordes before alleaged, whereby he would faine créepe out. The wordes are thus: <hi>There ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bread and wine.</hi> He addeth (<hi>or nature</hi>) ſaith the <hi>Anſw.</hi> to mollifie and interpret the word <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> as importing that the naturall properties of bread and wine remaine though the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be gone. A very naturall anſwere. Belike <hi>the ſubſtance remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,</hi> or <hi>there ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance,</hi> is as much as to ſay: <hi>the ſubſtance is quite gone and vtterly ceaſed, &amp; only the accidents remaine.</hi> But <hi>Gelaſius</hi> a little before ſpeaketh in the very ſame ſort concerning Chriſt, and ſheweth the meaning of his own wordes: <hi>We ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the propriety of each ſubſtance or nature, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth continually in Chriſt,</hi> where moſt plainely by the ſame phraſe of ſpéech he maketh ſubſtance and nature to import one thing. And if we will follow the <hi>Anſw.</hi> expoſition, we muſt ſay here in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Eutyches</hi> that not the ſubſtances themſelues, but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall properties of each ſubſtance abide ſtil in Chriſt, becauſe he ſaith <hi>ſubſtance or nature.</hi> Againe a little before that, he ſaith: <hi>There is no ſubſtance but it is called a nature, becauſe if the nature of any thing being, be remoued or taken away, the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo muſt needs be taken away.</hi> By which it is plaine, that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> nameth <hi>nature,</hi> no otherwiſe, but to ſignify the very ſubſtance, becauſe euery ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is called a nature. Otherwiſe when he nameth as oft he doth; <hi>propriety of nature,</hi> the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> muſt expound it to be mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>propriety of naturall properties,</hi> which is more abſurd then that his face can be bold to face it out. It is certaine therfore that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> by <hi>nature</hi> meaneth the very eſſentiall being of the thing. And ſo the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> cannot but know that in that whole diſputation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning two natures in Chriſt, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> by two natures vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

By which it is plaine that the <hi>paſſing ouer into a diuine ſubſtance</hi> doth not enforce any changing of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and nature, but only of the condition and vſe of the ſubſtance. And therfore <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius</hi> ſaith plainly that notwithſtanding this <hi>paſſing ouer into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſubſtance,</hi> yet the bread and wine continue ſtill in <hi>the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their owne nature,</hi> which is the ſame which he had ſaid before: <hi>There ceaſeth not to be the ſubſtance or nature of bread and wine.</hi> For wheras the <hi>Anſw.</hi> would haue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing in <hi>the propriety of their owne nature</hi> to be vnderſtood of the remaining of certaine properties of bread and wine without the ſubſtance, it is too groſſe and palpable ſhifting. For in the whole diſputation concerning two natures in our Sauiour Chriſt, that phraſe of ſpéech is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vſed both by <hi>Gelaſius, Leo, Vigilius</hi> and others to import the manhood of Chriſt not only in properties and qualities, which <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches</hi> would haue admitted, but alſo in truth and ſubſtance inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably being and remayning, which he would not graunt. Euery kind of thing hath his owne proper and diſtinct eſſence and being, wherby it is ſeuered from all other thinges, and from whence do iſſue immediatly certaine properties and qualities which are not incident vnto any other. Now this own-neſſe as I may call it, and diſtinctneſſe of eſſence &amp; being, theſe Fathers expreſſe by <hi>proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature,</hi> affirming that Chriſt continueth in the <hi>proprietie of both natures,</hi> namely ſo, as that each nature the Godhead &amp; the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood reteineth his own proper and diſtinct ſubſtance &amp; being. Now ſeing that the abiding of the bread and wine in <hi>the propriety of their nature,</hi> is vſed by <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in the place alleaged to declare that continuance of the manhood of Chriſt, it followeth neceſſarily that it muſt be vnderſtoode of the remaining not only of the properties but alſo of the ſubſtance of bread and wine: vnleſſe we will ouer turne all that thoſe Fathers haue diſputed againſt <hi>Eutiches,</hi> &amp; plead for him out of their owne wordes that though certaine properties and ſhewes of the manhood of Chriſt be remaining, yet the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof is aboliſhed. But the <hi>Anſw.</hi> as guilty in his owne conſcience of the vntruth &amp; vnſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of this anſwere flitteth from it &amp; ſaith
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8782:67"/> as I noted before, that it may be that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſomewhat of the ſubſtance did remaine, and therfore was ſomewhat of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion at leaſt, wheras he had ſaid before that whatſoeuer <hi>Gelaſius</hi> thought, he was far enough from our mind. And yet ſuch is his gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy head that by and by againe he ſaith that if ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be vnderſtood for ſubſtance indéede, then there ſhould follow this great abſurdity that Chriſt ſhould be perſonally vnited vnto the bread, and ſo ſhould conſiſt of thrée natures, the Godhead, the manhood, and the bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as it pleaſeth his wiſedom-hood full vntowardly, and vnhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely to conceiue. So that it may be by this dreame of his, that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> thought that Chriſt conſiſteth of thrée natures, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the manhood, and the breadhood, becauſe it may be that <hi>Gelaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> vnderſtood ſubſtance for ſubſtance indéed. He hath well deſerued for this his learned reaſon to be perſonally vnited vnto a cloakbag. This idle fancy of his ariſeth hereof, that he vnderſtandeth no other preſence but reall and bodily, nor other vniting but only perſonall. But of preſence, Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh as touching himſelfe: <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Whereſoeuer two or three are gathered togither in my name, there am I in the midſt of them:</hi> yet we know he is not bodily preſent vnto all ſuch. Nay as touching bodily preſence, S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpell, <note n="b" place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioh. tract. 50.</note> 
                     <hi>He is aſcended into heauen and is not here. But according to his diuine maieſtie, according to his prouidence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his vnſpeakable and inuiſible grace, it is fulfilled which he ſaid: I will be with you alwaies vnto the ende of the world.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Vigilius:</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Vigil. cont. Euty. lib. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt is with vs, and he is not with vs. According to the forme of a ſeruant, hee is abſent from vs; according to the forme of God, he is preſent with vs.</hi> Such is the preſence of Chriſt in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, euen <note n="d" place="margin">cypr. de cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na domini.</note> 
                     <hi>the preſence of his diuine power,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, wherby it commeth to paſſe, that as the Sun abiding bodily in the ſkie, yet by effect and working is here on the earth, cheriſhing and comforting all things according to their kinde, ſo the ſonne of righteouſnes Ieſus Chriſt, though according to his bodily preſence remaining only in heauen, yet by his heauenly grace and ſpirite is effectually preſent vnto vs in his holy ſacraments, communicating himſelfe fully and wholly vnto vs, and ioyning vs moſt néerly vnto himſelfe. As for that groſſe preſence which Papiſts teach, beſides that it is vnneceſſary, it repugneth alſo to that truth of the manhood of Chriſt, abiding in <hi>the proprietie of his owne nature,</hi> which <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:8782:67"/> defended and maketh for the hereſies of <hi>Marcion, Eutyches</hi> and others of whom I ſpake before. Now as the preſence of Chriſt in the ſacrament is not carnall and bodily, ſo no more is the vniting of Chriſt vnto the ſacrament any bodily or carnall matter, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and ſacramentall: whileſt by the word of God and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the holy Ghoſt, there is made that mutuall relation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect betwixt the ſigne &amp; the thing ſignified, and ſuch a dependence of the one on the other, that the ſigne ſpiritually implieth the force and vertue of the thing ſignified, and the holy Ghoſt togither with the ſigne, diſpenſeth through faith the fulneſſe of that grace &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which is conteined in the body and blood of Ieſus Chriſt. In which ſort we beléeue alſo that Chriſt without any real preſence is vnited to the ſacrament of Baptiſme, whereby we put on Chriſt, and are made members of his body, fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bones: neither is there any more reaſon to mainteine any real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the one ſacrament, then there is in the other. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the remaining of the ſubſtance of bread, doth not enforce any perſonall vniting of Chriſt vnto the bread. No, nor yet that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed real preſence of Chriſts body with the bread.

Only let me tell him, that he wretchedly peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the compariſon made by <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and maketh it fitly and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwerable to the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches.</hi> For as he ſaith, that in the ſacrament there is the very body of Chriſt, hauing conioyned vnto it the naturall properties of bread and wine, the ſubſtance being vaniſhed: ſo ſaid <hi>Eutyches</hi> that in the perſon of Chriſt there was the Godhead, retaining with it the properties of the manhood, to be viſible, paſſible, mortall, &amp;c. but the ſubſtance and diſtinct nature of the manhood was conſumed. Again he wittingly and willingly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifieth the ſtate of the queſtion which <hi>Gelaſius</hi> diſputed, as though he reaſoned to proue the continuing of the properties of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, not of the ſubſtance: whereas the purpoſe of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither concerning the ſubſtance and nature it ſelfe: which to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue inuiolably, notwithſtanding the aſſuming therof vnto the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, he ſheweth by compariſon of the ſacrament where the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread and wine remaineth, notwithſtanding they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced to that honour to be the myſteries of the body and bloud of Chriſt.

                  <p>NOw come to be handled the words of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> whom the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> vſeth in the ſame honeſt maner as he hath done <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius;</hi> yet cannot ſtoppe his mouth but that he ſtill ſtandeth at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Tranſubſtantiation. <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his Dialogues deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the whole matter of <hi>Eutyches</hi> his hereſie, not only as <hi>Eutyches</hi> himſelfe held it as before hath bene ſhewed, but alſo as ſome would ſeeme afterwards to correct it, by ſaying that though Chriſt reteined the ſubſtance of his manhood while he continued on the earth, yet after his aſcenſion it was turned into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as of which there was thenceforth no longer vſe. Now hauing diſputed the matter at large, and brought the heretick to this latter ſhift, he taketh an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the Sacrament, to proue the remaining and being of Chriſts bodie and blood. For ſignes or ſamptars are not admitted,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8782:70"/> but of ſuch things as haue being. Séeing therefore we receiue the myſticall ſignes in token of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the bodie and blood of Chriſt haue their owne nature and being. Now the hereticke taketh occaſion of this mention of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to reaſon thus: <hi>a Euen as the ſignes of the Lords bodie and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">o Theodor. dial. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>blood before the prieſts inuocation are other things, but after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation are chaunged and made other then before: ſo the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die after his aſſumption or taking vp into heauen, is changed into the diuine ſubſtance.</hi> Whereby being <hi>changed and made other,</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not any reall chaunging into the very body and blood of Chriſt, for he denied that Chriſt had now any ſubſtantiall bodie, neither doth he vnderſtand the looſing of their owne former ſubſtance, for he expreſly yéeldeth the contrary, as was ſhewed before in handling the place of <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> but only intendeth that they are other in vſe and name, being now made ſigns of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, which he once truly tooke, but afterwards did fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>go. This is plaine inough by the circumſtance of the place, and by that which he had confeſſed before in the former Dialogue, that <hi>the bread and wine were ſignes not of the diuine nature of Chriſt, but of thoſe things whoſe names they did beare,</hi> namely the bodie &amp; blood. But to the obiection <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> anſwereth thus: <hi>Thou art taken in the net, which thy ſelfe haſt made. For the myſticall ſignes do not depart from their owne nature after conſecration. For they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in their former ſubſtance, and figure and forme, and may be ſeene and touched as before. But they are vnderſtood to be the ſame which they are made, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued ſo, and adored as being the ſame that they are beleeued. Now therfore conferre the image with the principall, and thou ſhalt ſee the likeneſſe. For the figure muſt be like vnto the truth. Verily that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt hath alſo the ſame forme as before, the ſame figure, and circumſcription, and to ſpeake all at once, the ſame ſubſtance of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. But it is made immortal after his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> Here it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouched, that the myſticall ſignes continue not only in <hi>figure and ſhape,</hi> but alſo in <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> the ſame that they were before, and ſo as that in them we muſt take notice how Chriſt continueth the ſame in ſubſtance of his bodie after his aſcenſion. For the myſticall ſignes are the figure &amp; image of Chriſts bodie, and the figure muſt be correſpondent to the truth. And therefore if we finde not the true and proper ſubſtance remaining in the myſticall ſignes, neither can
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8782:70"/> it be auouched in the truth, that is in Chriſts bodie. What conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now then ſhall we haue of theſe words? Mary this. <hi>The</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſignes remaine in their former ſubſtance, that is to ſay, the formes haue a new ſubſiſtence by themſelues, and the accidents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine without the ſubſtance. Bread and wine after conſecration remaine in their former ſubſtance; that is to ſay, there is the colour of bread and wine, the taſte of bread &amp; wine, the force and ſtrength of bread and wine, the quantitie and qualitie of bread and wine, but there is no ſubſtance of bread and wine. I wonder whether theſe men be perſwaded of the truth of theſe vnreaſonable and ſenſeleſſe expoſitions. If they be, it is fulfilled in them which is written, <note n="b" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 11</note> 
                     <hi>God ſhall ſend vpon them ſtrong deluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they may beleeue lies, which beleeued not the truth, &amp;c.</hi> If not, then <note n="c" place="margin">Eſa. 5. 20.</note> Wo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>to them that call good euill, and euill good, which put light for darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and darkneſſe for light.</hi> The thing is plaine inough. The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſignes ſaith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> remaine in their former ſubſtance. What was their former ſubſtance? The verie true and proper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſubſtance of bread &amp; wine. They continue therfore in the true and proper being and ſubſtance of bread and wine. But the <hi>Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> goeth from ſubſtance which <hi>Theodoret</hi> nameth, to ſubſiſtence of his owne forging; and yet euen there confoundeth himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recouery. For what was their former ſubſiſtence? Mary, they ſubſiſted before in the natures of bread and wine, ſaith the <hi>Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> And how now? They ſubſiſt now by the power of God, ſaith he, and haue their being by themſelues. But that cannot be, for they muſt abide in their former ſubſiſtence, and that was in the natures of bread and wine. Therefore there muſt ſtill be bread and wine wherin theſe formes and myſticall ſignes muſt ſubſiſt. And yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if theſe words of <hi>Theodoret</hi> do not import the remaining of the very ſubſtance of bread &amp; wine, the hereticke is not at al caught, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> telleth him that he is. For he hath to reply, &amp; would haue replied if Tranſubſtantiation had bene then beléeued. As it is in the myſticall ſignes which are the image, ſo muſt it be in the truth, which is, the body of Chriſt. The myſticall ſignes looſe their ſubſtance after conſecration. Therfore the body of Chriſt looſeth his ſubſtance after his aſcenſion. But indéede the argument ſtandeth firme againſt the hereticke with <hi>Theodoret,</hi> as it did with <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi> As it is in the myſticall ſignes, ſo it muſt be in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body of Chriſt.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8782:71"/> The myſticall ſignes kéepe their ſubſtance after conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Without doubt <hi>Theodoret</hi> was ſome Prophet, and had ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reuelation to this purpoſe, to know what ſhould be agreed vpon in the Laterane Councell; and maruell it is, that for this cauſe he was not ſainted in the Roman Calender. But a liar they ſay ſhould beare a braine, and the <hi>Anſw.</hi> and his fellowes ſhould remember, that if theſe things were added ſince in later times, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues confeſſe, then <hi>Theodoret</hi> had neuer any intelligence of them as indéed he had not. To leaue this and to go forward; he now ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth further into the words of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and openeth that which I concealed, &amp; weigheth euery word at large, and when all is done, <hi>Parturiunt montes, naſcetur ridiculus mus. <hi>Theodoret,</hi>
                     </hi> as he ſaith, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſet down one part of the Sacrament which he calleth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> formes of bread and wine, commeth to ſet downe the other to be the reall bodie and blood of Chriſt, and that in theſe wordes: <hi>The myſticall ſignes are vnderſtood to be the ſame that they are made, &amp; are ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, and adored as being the ſame that they are beleeued.</hi> Now hereof he gathereth, that they are vnderſtood to be the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt, and it may not be a falſe vnderſtanding, therfore they are ſo indéede: and ſo they are beléeued to be, and adored not as being ſignes of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, but as being the ſame indéed. How pretily this man plaieth with a ſhadow, and ſolaceth himſelfe with a large deſcription of his idle fancie. Who told him, I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that this was <hi>Theodorets</hi> meaning? Surely he tooke it out of ſome of his learned Treatiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beléeued it as an Oracle <hi>Ex tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pode.</hi> But let me demaund of him, are the formes of bread and wine vnderſtood to be, to be, I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt, are they belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8782:71"/> to be ſo; are they adored as being not ſignes, but verily &amp; indeed the bodie and blood of Chriſt? What new ſtuffe is this, that formes of bread and wine be indéed Chriſts bodie and blood, and muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored with godly honor, as the <hi>Anſw.</hi> meaneth adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Is Chriſts bodie now become formes of bread; and muſt we adore and worſhip formes of bread? That is idolatry euen by the confeſſion of his own ſide. But he will except and tell me that, not the formes, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die conteined vnder them is adored? Yea but he hath told me alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and <hi>Theodorets</hi> words as he expoundeth them import no other, that the formes are the bodie of Chriſt &amp; are adored as being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed. Cleare it is, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> referreth that adoration, which he ſpeaketh of, to the myſticall ſignes. So that the <hi>Anſw.</hi> muſt either make himſelfe an idolater, and muſt turne the bodie and blood of Chriſt into formes of bread and wine, or elſe he muſt ſéeke a new conſtruction of <hi>Theodorets</hi> words. The meaning is plain. The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical ſignes before conſecration are (not myſtical ſignes but) méer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread and wine. By conſecration they are made <hi>ſymbola mystica corporis &amp; ſanguinis domini: <hi>myſticall ſignes of the bodie and blood of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </hi> And notwithſtanding that after conſecration they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their former ſubſtance, yet are they vnderſtood and beléeued to be not only that which they are in ſubſtance, but the ſame that they are made, that is, ſignes of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and are honoured and reuerenced as being tranſlated from common vſe to be, as they are made, myſtical ſignes of Chriſts body and blood. And this to be the plaine meaning of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> it appeareth by that which he addeth immediatly; for hauing thus ſet downe the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſignes, though in ſubſtance bread and wine as they were before, yet vnderſtood to be the ſignes of Chriſts bodie and blood, he addeth: <hi>Confer then the image with the paterne or principall, and thou ſhalt ſee the likeneſſe. For the figure muſt be agreeable or anſwerable to the truth.</hi> Where we ſée that he calleth the myſticall ſignes which he hath ſpoken of, <hi>the image and figure,</hi> not for that which they are in ſubſtance, but for that which they are vnderſtood to be made: and on the other ſide, the bodie of Chriſt wherof they are the image and figure, he calleth the patterne, the principal, the truth; and inferreth hereof, that as theſe ſignes though they be thus highly honoured to be the images, the ſignes, the figures of the bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt, yet are in ſubſtance and nature the ſame ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo the bodie of Chriſt

Thus <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> will in no wiſe yéeld to be made a Patrone, either of real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or of Tranſubſtantiation. His iudgement is ſo cleare in theſe points, that he ſheweth but a naughtie and leaud minde, whoſoeuer ſhall go about to father any of theſe matters vpon him. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Dialogue he ſaith plainly; that Chriſt in <hi>the deliuerie of the myſteries called bread his bodie; that he ſet vpon the ſigne the name of his bodie; that he honoured the myſticall ſignes with the name of his bodie and blood, not chaunging their nature, but adding grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature; that the holie foode is the ſigne and figure of the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> And in this dialogue againe, <hi>that the myſtical ſignes of the bodie and blood of Chriſt are offered to God by the prieſts of God; that the myſticall ſignes do repreſent the true bodie: that they are the image and figure of Chriſts bodie;</hi> and maketh a manifeſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the <hi>bodie it ſelfe and the myſticall ſigne which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the bodie.</hi> By all which ſpéeches he declareth that the myſticall ſignes are truly bread and wine, yet by conſecration made figures of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and called by the name of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, as Sacraments are wont to be called by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of the things whereof they are Sacraments, to lift vp our mindes from the beholding of the viſible elements, to the conſideration of the thinges ſignified by them, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> in the firſt Dialogue ſheweth. And therefore the Prieſt hath not in his hands the reall bodie of Chriſt to offer vp vnto God, but only the myſticall ſignes which repreſent the bodie; ſo that both Tranſubſtantiation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all preſence, and reall ſacrifice, are all ouerthrowne by <hi>Theodorets</hi> iudgement. Now whereas the <hi>Anſw.</hi> vrgeth that we receiue the bodie and blood of Chriſt, <hi>Theodoret</hi> indeed ſaith, that he beléeueth that he is made a partaker thereof in receiuing the Sacrament. We beleeue the ſame, and it is our ſingular comfort. But this receiuing of Chriſt is not really by the mouth into the bodie, but ſpiritually by faith into the ſoule.

For euen ſo the ſacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud of Chriſt, is after a ſorte, that is, by reſemblance the body and bloud of Chriſt: not verily and indeed then, but after a ſorte and by reſemblance, and ſo by reſemblance called the bodie and the bloud of Chriſt: for as the ſacrament of the body, is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſo the ſacrament of faith, is faith. The ſacrament of faith, is not faith indeed, but by queſtions and anſweres of faith, it betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the faith of Chriſtian men.

The reaſon whereof, is becauſe the viſible ſignes which beare the name of the fleſh, and bloud of Chriſt, are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, and therefore not onely haue the name, but conteine the force and power of that true fleſh and blood of Chriſt where in he ſuffered for our ſinnes.

But let <hi>Cyprian</hi> be further aſked: what is it that Chriſt calleth his bodie? He ſaith, it is bread. What is it that Chriſt calleth his bloud? It is wine. <hi>Chriſt calleth the

The <hi>Anſw.</hi> in vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Church with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> want hereof, doth much more lay open the ſhame and reproch of his owne friendes. The Church of Roome is ſhe that hath broken the bonds of all diſcipline, and made a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of all religion: in ſtéed of abſoluing men, ſhe hath bound them faſter: in ſtéed of reconcilement to God, ſhe hath thruſt them further off from God. Whatſoeuer defect or want our Church hath in this be halfe, it is but aſker of that wound, wherewith the Church of Roome had wounded vs, and as a weakeneſſe remaining after a gréeuous and deadly ſickneſſe from whence we haue not as yet béen able perfectly to recouer our ſelues.

                  <p>Concerning the <hi>deſcending of Chriſt into hell,</hi> I doubt not but he ſpeaketh what he thinketh, but vnderſtandeth not what he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, nor what he ought to thinke. The iudgement of learned and godly men, both old and new are very diuerſe, as touching the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this point. I preiudicate not the iudgement of any man that hath not in it a preiudice againſt y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word of God. For my part I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as an article of the Créede, and I take it that I am to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euery article of the Créede, as importing ſomewhat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and properly concerneth my ſelf, either as touching my crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſaluation. And therefore I ſimply reiect as a méere fancie, the opinion of the Papiſts, that Chriſt deſcended to <hi>Linebus patrum,</hi> to fetch the fathers from thence. But if for any reſpect properly touching our ſaluation, it may be iuſtified that Chriſt in ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the very place of hell, as the very letter of the article doth import, I willingly ſubſcribe the ſame. In the meane time that which the <hi>Anſw.</hi> cauilleth at, which ſome learned men haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered for the meaning of Chriſtes deſcending into hell, as touching the doctrine, whether belonging to this article, or to the other of his <hi>ſuffering,</hi> I embrace and hold becauſe I know it conteineth the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine &amp; vndoubted trueth of the word of God, and particularly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the redemption of mine own ſoule.

                     <hi>Here God the father dealeth with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8782:81"/> Chriſt, not as a father, but as a tyrant, although hee be in the meane time of moſt louing affection towardes him. This Chriſtes being forſaken is the dread of our conſcience for our ſinnes, feeling the iudgement of God, and his eternall wrath: and is ſo affected, as if it were for euer forſaken and reiected from the face of God. Chriſt of his mercie put himſelfe into our cauſe, and vndertooke the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we had deſerued. Therefore on the one ſide wee ſee the people reuiling him, the Phariſees blaſpheming him, &amp;c. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide we ſee God as an aduerſarie forſaking him; ſo that he crieth out, why haſt thou forſaken me. Chriſt to deliuer ſinners, ſet himſelf in place of all ſinners, not playing the theefe, or adulterer. &amp;c: but transferring vnto himſelf the ſtipend and wages, the puniſhment and deſert of ſinners, as colde, heate, hunger, thirſt, feare, trembling, the horrour of death, the horrour of hell, deſpaire, death, hell it ſelf, that by feare he might ouercome feare, by horrour, deſpaire, death, hell, might ouercome horror, deſpaire, death, hell, and in a word by Satan might ouercome Satan.</hi> Thus by the teſtimonie of one of their own Prophets, it is iuſtified that Chriſt Ieſus ſuffered not onely a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death, but alſo in his ſoule the waight of his fathers indignation, and the very horrour of hell it ſelfe, when he cried out and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that maner as hath béen declared. And this is that which the ſcripture meaneth when it ſaith that <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for vs to deliuer vs from the curſe.</hi> For as to be <hi>made ſinne for vs,</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that he did beare the puniſhment of our ſinnes, ſo to <hi>be made a curſe for vs,</hi> importeth that he did beare the burden of our curſe, that is to ſay, the full meaſure of the wrath of God, that otherwiſe ſhould haue lighted vpon vs. The fathers thought no leſſe, when they conſtrued the 88. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> or the 87. as they reckon it to be the deſcription of the paſſion of Chriſt.

Which indéed ſhould haue oppreſſed vs infinitely and without end, becauſe the infinite maieſtie of God, whom we had offended, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an infinite ſatiſfaction for the offence, and the ſame could not be yéelded by vs, but by infinite and endleſſe bearing of his wrath. But it neither would nor might hold Chriſt in that ſort, becauſe the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe of the time was recompenſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infiniteneſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was not onely man but God alſo. Now whereas it is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that one drop of the bloud of Chriſt, was ſufficient to redeeme the world, I anſwere that it is folly héereof to conclude, that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not in his ſoule for vs, and with as good reaſon they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he was not crowned with thornes, ſpitted vpon, mocked and reuiled, &amp;c. Yea y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he died not at all, nor ſhed any more but one drop of bloud.

For the ſcripture is not wont to ſet down tokens and figures of things, which haue not the truth of the things anſwerable vnto them. Therefore ſéeing Chriſt in the Goſpell gaue bread as a token and figure of his bodie, ſaying, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> that is to ſay, a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of my bodie, it is certaine that Chriſt hath a true bodie corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to this figure.

For his expoſition beſide that it is fooliſh and abſurd, maketh alſo expreſly againſt himſelfe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth that which I deſire, and which he himſelfe muſt néeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8782:89"/> to be the vndooing of Tranſubſtantiation. He maketh two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>Tertullians</hi> words: the one ours and that thus; <hi>This is my bodie, that is to ſay, this is a figure of my bodie:</hi> and this being indéed the currant and direct paſſage of <hi>Tertullians</hi> words, he diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and condemneth. The other is theirs, and as he would make vs beléeue the verie intended meaning of the words, namely thus, <hi>This is my bodie: This, that is to ſay, the figure of my bodie is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> Whereby he briefly reſolueth out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> a maruellous doubt wherof his Fathers were neuer able to determine any thing; namely, whereto the word <hi>This</hi> is to be applied. For if it be ſayd, <hi>This bread</hi> which is the very truth, then they ſawe that Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation cannot ſtand. Therefore haue they prophaned the ſacred words of Chriſt with their curſed ſophiſtications, and haue moſt wretchedly toſſed them too and fro to make a meaning of them that might ſerue for their purpoſe, &amp; yet haue found none. But the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſetteth downe the meaning thus: <hi>This figure of my bodie is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> So that the word <hi>This,</hi> muſt be referred to the figure of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. And what figure? The olde figure euen the ſame ſaith he that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> vſed. And what was that olde figure? Marry it was bread. Then we haue the expoſition of Chriſtes words as we would haue it; <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>This bread is my bodie.</hi> And this is manifeſt to be <hi>Tertullians</hi> mind, by that he ſaith twiſe in this place, that <hi>Chriſt called bread his bodie;</hi> and in his booke againſt the Iewes ſaith in like ſort that <hi>he called bread his bodie;</hi> and in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> ſaith againe that <hi>Chriſt repreſented his bodie by bread.</hi> Now if Chriſt in the Sacrament call bread his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and by bread do repreſent his bodie, then it followeth that in the Sacrament it is bread which is called the bodie of Chriſt, and is ſo called, becauſe the bodie of Chriſt is repreſented thereby. Therefore the meaning of Chriſts words muſt néeds be thus; <hi>This bread is the figure of my bodie.</hi> This were ſufficient for the opening of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> minde in this point, but yet I will follow the <hi>Anſw.</hi> to ſift the matter ſomewhat further. I acknowledge firſt with him, that <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> purpoſe in that place is to ſhewe that Chriſt fulfilled in the new Teſtament thoſe things that were foretold and foreſhewed in the old. But as it was neuer prefigured in the old Teſtament that there ſhould be a tranſubſtantiation of the bread &amp; wine, ſo no more doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> go about by any old figure to approue the ſame. And
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8782:89"/> if he had named <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> or alluded vnto him any way as we are by this man borne in hand, yet could it not haue bene to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe but this, that <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> by bringing foorth bread and wine in figure of the Sacrament, did ſignifie that Chriſt ſhould appoint and inſtitute bread and wine to be the tokens and ſignes of his bodie and blood; and that Chriſt in the Goſpell did fulfil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. So ſaith S. <hi>Hierom:</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Hieron. in Mat. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt taketh bread &amp; goeth to the true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the paſſeouer that as Melchiſedech the prieſt of the high God in prefiguring of him, offering bread and wine had done, ſo he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo might repreſent the truth of his bodie and blood.</hi> Therfore though it be graunted that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> yet ſerueth it my purpoſe and not his; that Chriſt inſtituted bread and wine, to repreſent thereby the truth of his bodie and blood, as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> had prefigured he ſhould do. But the truth is, <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh not of <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> he doth not ſo much as intimate any thing of him; and the <hi>Anſw.</hi> for that he read the place could not but know that there was nothing meant as touching <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and therefore in vpbraiding vs with ſtealing of ſcrappes out of the Fathers, becauſe we vſe this place, he giueth me occaſion to charge him with voluntary and wilfull falſifying of their words. But I leaue that to his owne conſcience, whether he did purpoſely ſéeke by this bad meanes to adde the more likelihood vnto a falſe tale. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith nothing here to intimate that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very creatures of bread and wine were vſed in the old Teſtament as figures of the body and blood of Chriſt, but only expoundeth ſome places where the names of bread and wine are ſo vſed, as that thereby ſhould be ſignified the ſame bodie &amp; blood of Chriſt. To this purpoſe he alleageth the words of <hi>Ieremy</hi> as the vulgar Latine text readeth them, <note n="e" place="margin">Ier. 11. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Let vs caſt the wood vpon his bread, that is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the croſſe vpon his bodie,</hi> as noting that by the name of bread the Prophet ſignified the bodie of Chriſt. Therefore he addeth, <hi>Chriſt the reuealer of antiquities, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bread his bodie, did ſufficiently declare what his will was that bread ſhould then ſignifie.</hi> Whereby he giueth to vnderſtand that as the Prophet did vſe the name of bread to ſignifie the body of Chriſt, ſo Chriſt himſelfe to iuſtifie that ſpéech of the Prophet, did inſtitute bread it ſelfe to be the ſigne and Sacrament of his bodie, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly called it his bodie. Another like ſpéech he reciteth concerning wine out of the words of <hi>Iacob</hi> the Patriarch, <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 49. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>He ſhall waſh his

Hereupon he inferreth; <hi>He that then figured wine in blood, hath now conſecrated his blood in wine;</hi> noting hereby not that blood indéed was vſed for a figure of wine, but that the name of <hi>the blood of the grape</hi> ſerued to ſignifie wine, as prefiguring that wine it ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ſhould be appointed to be the ſigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blood of Chriſt. Now this was fulfilled by Chriſt when <hi>he conſecrated his blood in wine,</hi> that is to ſay, made the Sacrament of his blood in wine, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed wine in truth to be the Sacrament of his blood, for ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whereof, the name of wine had bene before vſed. The old fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure the refore of which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaketh, ſaying; that we <hi>may acknowledge an olde figure in wine,</hi> was in the vſe of the names of bread and wine, not of bread and wine indéed: and that which by this olde figure and maner of ſpeaking was intimated in the olde Teſtament, Chriſt performed and fulfilled in the new, when he conſecrated and ſanctified his creatures of bread and wine to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and figures of his bodie and blood, and by name according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called them his bodie and blood. Which maner of ſpeaking he had not approued but fruſtrated, if in making the Sacrament he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the ſubſtance of bread and wine: for then he could not haue called bread his bodie and wine his blood, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith he did. Now therefore that which the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Figures are of the old Teſtament, &amp; Chriſt fulfilleth them in the new,</hi> maketh nothing againſt vs, nay ſetting aſide the error of the <hi>Anſw.</hi> it maketh whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for vs. For he vainly fancieth <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to ſay that the very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of bread &amp; wine were vſed in the old Teſtament for figures of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and therefore that the ſame ſhould not be againe appointed to that vſe in the new Teſtament, whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith no more but only that the names or words of bread and wine were ſometimes taken to ſignifie the ſame. Now then let him remember that <hi>Turtullian</hi> auoucheth the fulfilling of this figure in this, that <hi>Chriſt called bread his bodie</hi> and wine his blood, and let him ſay with vs according to <hi>Tertullians</hi> minde, that in the Sacrament it is bread and wine which is called the bodie and blood of Chriſt; and that the meaning of Chriſts words is, <hi>This bread is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8782:90"/> my bodie,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>A Figure of my bodie.</hi> Now hereby <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> proueth, that Chriſt hath a true ſubſtantiall bodie. For ſaith he, <hi>It had bene no Figure except there were a true bodie. For an emptie thing as is a fantaſie, might not haue bene capable of a Figure.</hi> But here the <hi>Anſw.</hi> wold make vs beléeue, that vnleſſe <hi>Tertullian</hi> mean this of a Figure in the old Teſtament, his ſaying is not true. And this he proueth by Nigromancy: for ſaith he, the phantaſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of ſpirits do exhibit to the eyes a certaine Figure or ſhape, as the very Nigromancers do know. But what motion I maruel came into the mans minde to diuert his ſpéech from myſticall and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall figures inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt wherof <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, to figures and facions, and ſhapes of diuels and ſpirits. He was a blind man if he ſaw not his owne errour and folly, but leaud and wretched if he ſawe it, and yet againſt his owne conſcience would thus dally with Gods truth. And why could he not conceiue that <hi>Tertullians</hi> wordes if they had concerned any ſuch figures, ſhould haue bin falſe in reſpect of the old Teſtament as well as of the new, becauſe diuels and ſpirits had their figures and ſhapes as wel then as now. Was it ſtraunge vnto him that there are ſacramentall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new Teſtament, to which the words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> might be fitly applied. Surely S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, that <note n="g" place="margin">Auguſt. in Pſal. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt admitted Iudas to that banquet, wherein he commended to his Diſciples the Figure of his body and blood.</hi> So ſaith the old Father <hi>Ephrem,</hi> that <note n="h" place="margin">Ephrem. de natura dei no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcrutanda. cap. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt bleſſed and brake the bread in figure of his bodie, and bleſſed &amp; gaue the cup in Figure of his pretious blood.</hi> Nay the <hi>Anſw.</hi> himſelfe hath confeſſed <note n="i" place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> before that the Fathers call the ſacrifice which they ſpeak of, a figure of the death and paſſion of Chriſt. Of ſuch a figure <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeaketh and reaſoneth thus, that there ſhould neuer haue bin appointed in the Goſpel a figure to repreſent the body of Chriſt, except there had bene a true bodie to be repreſented thereby. As for that cauill of his which he hath borrowed from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that if <hi>Tertullian</hi> had not ſpoken of a figure in the old Teſtament, he ſhuld not haue ſaid, <hi>fuiſſet,</hi> but <hi>eſſet,</hi> it is too too fooliſh and abſurd, and if he were in the Grammer ſchoole, he ſhould deſerue to be laide ouer the forme, to make him know that the verbe <hi>fuiſſet</hi> is rightly vſed by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> with relation to Chriſts firſt inſtituting of bread to be the figure of his bodie. Let him conſider better, whether this ſtand not with good conſtruction to ſay; <hi>Chriſt tooke bread and ſaid therof,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8782:91"/> This is my bodie, that is to ſay, a figure of my bodie. But it had not bene, or it ſhould not haue bene a figure except there were a true bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> But yet he goeth farther: <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith thus: <hi>If Chriſt did therefore make bread his bodie becauſe he wanted a true bodie, then he ſhould haue giuen the bread for vs. It made for the vanitie of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that bread ſhould be crucified.</hi> Theſe words ſaith he, haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wit nor ſenſe, except it be ſuppoſed that Chriſts bodie is really in the Sacrament, nay otherwiſe it muſt be bread that was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for vs. But except his wit and his ſenſe did faile him, he might find ſomwhat els in <hi>Tertullians</hi> words. For ſtil he calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bread, &amp; putteth differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the bread that is called y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true body it ſelf, &amp; ſo reaſoneth againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> if Chriſt had not a true body indéed which he repreſented by bread, &amp; in reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of called the ſame bread his body, then the bread itſelfe muſt be his bodie, and conſequently it was bread which was giuen and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for vs. But <hi>Marcion</hi> himſelfe would not ſay that bread was crucified for vs: Therefore he muſt néedes confeſſe that Chriſt had a true bodie figured by the bread. And thus <hi>Tertullians</hi> reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marcion</hi> ſetteth downe bread in the Sacrament as a figure of Chriſtes body, and razeth the foundation of Popiſh Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. And this is yet againe plaine by theſe wordes, to which he aſketh me what I ſay, that Chriſt called not a Pepon his body as he ſhould haue done by <hi>Marcions</hi> opinion, who held that Chriſt had in ſtéede of a heart, a kinde of fruite called a Pepon: but hee called <hi>bread his body</hi> becauſe of the <hi>olde Figure,</hi> namely becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vſing the name of bread to import the bodie of Chriſt, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prefigure that bread indéed ſhould be appointed to be the figure and ſigne of the ſame bodie. So that Chriſt did not renew an olde figure by conſecrating or ſanctifying the bread to be a figure of his bodie, but fulfilled that in the trueth and ſubſtance of bread, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith was foreſhewed by the name of bread. Thus much of <hi>Tertullians</hi> roundly &amp; wholly deliuered words, where the <hi>Anſw.</hi> hath ſhewed as great folly, in enlarging them, as ſome other of his fellowes haue ſhewed falſhood in clipping and paring them.

                     <hi>image or reſemblance of the bodie and bloud of Chriſt, is celebrated in the action of the myſteries or ſacraments.</hi> Héereby <hi>Gelaſius</hi> giueth to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the ſacrament is not the verie bodie of Chriſt, but the image and reſemblance of his body. It is more plaine by that which he addeth: <hi>We muſt therfore think the ſame of Chriſt himſelfe, which we profeſſe in his image,</hi> that is to ſay, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Marke how he diſtinguiſheth <hi>Chriſt himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>the image of Chriſt.</hi> The Sacrament therefore which is the image of Chriſt, is not Chriſt himſelfe. Thus the wordes themſelues doe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly giue that for which I alleaged them. But the <hi>Anſw.</hi> telleth me that I alleage <hi>Gelaſius</hi> héere contrarie to his owne meaning, euen by mine own confeſſion. How may that be? Forſooth I would before haue <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his drift to be that as Chriſt is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in two natures: ſo héere vpon the earth in the ſacrament is bread with the body, and ſo both in heauen and héere would haue two ſeuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but nowe in this place I would haue the Sacrament to be nothing but a ſigne, and bare bread in one nature onely. But hée knoweth that he ſpeaketh vntrueth both in the one and in the other. Of the former he himſelfe hath acquited me before, ſaying; <note n="b" place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>you would haue the Sacrament a memorie of Chriſt as though hee were abſent.</hi> Then belike I would not haue the bodie of Chriſt really preſent héere vpon the earth in the Sacrament. Of the other I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited my ſelfe in that very place which he taketh vpon him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. For I added immediately vpon the alleaging of thoſe words, thus. <hi>Yet are not the Sacraments naked &amp; bare ſignes as you are wont hereupon to cauill, but ſubſtantiall and effectuall ſigns or ſeales rather, aſſuring our faith of the things ſealed therby, and deliuering as it were into our hands and poſſeſſion, the whole fruite &amp; benefit of the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> To anſwere him to both in a word, thus
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8782:93"/> I ſay: that as the water of Baptiſme doth ſacramentally imply the blood of Chriſt, though the blood of Chriſt be in heauen: ſo likewiſe the bread and wine in the Lordes Supper, do ſacramentally imply the bodie and blood of Chriſt, though the ſame bodie and blood be in heauen and not vpon the earth. And therefore neither did I before ſay nor do now, that the Sacrament conſiſteth of two natures, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being vpon earth, but of bread and wine being on earth, and the bodie and blood of Chriſt being in heauen: the one receiued by the hand of the bodie; the other only by the hand of the ſoule, which only reacheth vnto heauen. Againe, as water in Baptiſme is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bare water, becauſe the blood of Chriſt is not there really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; ſo no more is the bread of the Lords table bare bread, although there be no reall preſence of the bodie, but it doth moſt effectually of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and yéelde vnto the beléeuing ſoule the aſſurance of the grace of God, and of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. That which he further addeth as touching the drift and purpoſe of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> how lewdly it peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his wordes and maketh them to ſerue fully for the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches</hi> againſt which <hi>Gelaſius</hi> writeth, I haue declared before, and ſo well haue I bethought my ſelfe héereof, as that I doubt I may in that behalfe, charge the <hi>Anſw.</hi> conſcience with voluntarie and wilfull falſhood and deſperate fighting againſt God.</p>

They both argue alike vpon the word <hi>made.</hi> For anſwere hereof I ſhewed how <hi>Tertullian</hi> expoundeth his owne meaning by theſe wordes, <hi>that is to ſay, a figure of his bodie.</hi> Further I ſaid, that that phraſe or maner of ſpéech <hi>Chriſt made the bread his bodie,</hi> doth not enforce any Tranſubſtantiation.

                     <hi>The word was made fleſh.</hi> For as it was abſurdly gathered by the Timotheans, that becauſe the <hi>word was made fleſh,</hi> therefore it ceaſed to be the word; ſo as fondly is it gathered by the Papiſts of <hi>Tertullians</hi> words, that becauſe the <hi>bread is made the bodie of Chriſt,</hi> therfore it ceaſeth to be bread.

The ſpéeches are like: <hi>The word was made fleſh: the bread is made the bodie of Chriſt.</hi> Now hath he not ſent me a worthy anſwere to this? The words of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith he, what proue they touching the Sacrament? What argument is this? <hi>The word was made fleſh,</hi> the ſenſe is, the word aſſumpted fleſh vnto it. And it is not to be taken as the words do ſound, therefore this text, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> is not to be taken as the words import. A verie mightie vpſtantiall argument.

I haue anſwered before, that the vnion of Chriſt with the Sacrament is not perſonall or reall as he vnderſtandeth reall; but relatiue and ſacramentall, as in Baptiſme alſo it is. But as the word remaineth being perſonally vnited to the fleſh, ſo the bread remaineth being ſacramentally vnited vnto Chriſt.

                  <p>Now for further declaration of the words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> I allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a ſaying of S. <hi>Auſten: Chriſt hath commended vnto vs in this Sacrament his bodie and blood; which alſo he hath made vs, and by his mercy we are the ſame that we receiue.</hi> Wheras the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſaith, that the firſt part of this ſentence ſerueth very wel for him, it is but like the dotage of the melancholy Athenian.

                     <hi>Sitting in heauen to be receiued by faith.</hi> But as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid; <hi>Chriſt made the bread his bodie,</hi> ſo here <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith: <hi>Chriſt hath made vs his bodie and blood.</hi> The maner of ſpéech is here alſo alike; and therefore I inferred hereof, that <hi>Tertullians</hi> words do no more proue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the bread is tranſubſtantiated into the body of Chriſt, then S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> do proue, that there is a tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie of Chriſt.

But what anſwere maketh he? Forſooth it would aſke a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to anſwere me: and therefore he hath thought good not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me at all. For as for that which he ſaith, it ſerueth directly for me. We are become one with Chriſt; ſaith he: let him ſpeake as S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeaketh; we are made the bodie of Chriſt, not by being tranſubſtantiated into him, but by being ioyned vnto him. So ſay we, that the bread is made the bodie of Chriſt, not by being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into his bodie, but by hauing tied vnto it by the word of God the promiſe of that grace and bleſſing that is yéelded vnto vs by and in the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8782:98"/> and the Goſpell condemneth both alike. The fond diſtinction of the maner maketh no difference in that behalfe. As for ſaint <hi>Auſten,</hi> he declareth his meaning plainly in his ſermon to the people. Hée knoweth none of theſe maners and péeuiſh differences, but ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of eating and drinking with the mouth, he giueth them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it is but the ſacrament which they eate and drinke, not the fleſh and bloud it ſelfe. <hi>Ye ſhall not eate the body, ye ſhall not drinke the bloud. I haue commended to you a Sacrament.</hi> In another place intreating of the verie ſame matter, hee noteth that Chriſt ſignified to his hearers, that hee would goe vp into heauen whole, that they might vnderſtand that he ſpake not of that eating his very body. <note n="c" place="margin">Aug. in Ioh. tra. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>They thought that hee would giue them his</hi> very <hi>body,</hi> but <hi>he told them that he would go vp into heauen, euen whole.</hi> Thus that we may not thinke that either péecemeale or whole wée eate the very body, he giueth vs to vnderſtand that he is aſcended to heauen entire &amp; whole.

                     <hi>ſhould it be that all the world ſhould eate of his fleſh which would ſuffice but a few men? But therefore our Lord, when he ſpake vnto his Apoſtles of the eating of his fleſh, made mention of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention vnto heauen, that hee might withdraw them from corporall and fleſhly vnderſtanding.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> eating of Chriſt whole, is indéed but a fiction and abſurd ſhift.

The true and reall fleſh of Chriſt is not eaten péecemeale.

                     <hi>We muſt take heede that we take not a figuratiue ſpeech according to the letter.

For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth the Capernaites when they heard Chriſt ſpeake of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, might imagine, as indéed they did, ſaith he, that they ſhould eat it in gobbets, cut, ſlaſhed and hewed, &amp;c. Therfore they muſt néeds by <hi>S. Auſtens</hi> rule flee to a milder ſenſe, and to a more humane mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Then belike S. <hi>Auſten</hi> taught the Capernaites howe they ſhould haue vnderſtoode the wordes of Chriſt, but hee teacheth not vs. For we are farre from imagining the eating of Chriſtes fleſhe in gobbets, ſlaſhed, hewed, chopt in péeces, as the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſpeaketh with his butcherly and barbarous termes. Alas children ſée the folly of theſe anſweres. S. <hi>Auſten</hi> in that place giueth vs a rule of vnderſtanding the ſcriptures. He giueth this place for an example of his rule. He teacheth vs that to eat and drink the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt importeth a horrible and hainous thing, if we vnderſtand eating and drinking properly. He talketh not of ſlaſhing or hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> and therefore telleth vs that wée muſt vnderſtand eating and drinking not properly, but by a figure. He telleth vs what the meaning of it is, as I haue ſhewed before. Not a word to intimate any ſuch Popiſh conſtruction: nay he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth it as a hainous and wicked imagination. The matter is cléere. Euery eye may diſcerne it. As for that which he aſketh whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt doe not giue himſelfe verily vnto vs, wee ſay he doth, and that wholly with all that is his; yet not to be eaten with the mouth as being héere on earth, but to be receiued by faith ſitting in heauen, as I ſaid before out of S. <hi>Auſten.</hi> And this is enough for vs to prooue, and in proouing wherof we confound that <note n="c" place="margin">Supr. ſect. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>groſſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> as <hi>Cyrill</hi> calleth it of eating the fleſhe of Chriſt, with the mouth into the belly. For that Chriſt at his ſupper giueth onely a figure and nothing elſe: we néede not prooue it, becauſe it is not our aſſertion, but the <hi>Anſw.</hi> cauill and a Popiſh ſlaunder. As for the meaning of Chriſtes wordes, <hi>This is my body,</hi> it is ſhewed before. Chriſt did not lie to his Diſciples, nor beguile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſo ſaying. His Diſciples were no Capernaites, they were no Papiſtes. They knew that Chriſt inſtituted &amp; deliuered a ſacrament. They knew that ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are called by the names of thoſe things which they ſignifie, whereof they had example in the name of the paſſeouer,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8782:100"/> which they celebrated at the ſame time, calling it the <hi>Paſſeouer,</hi> which was indéede but a remembronce and ſigne thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vnderſtood the meaning of Chriſt to be as the ancient Fathers expound it: <hi>This is a Figure, a ſigne, a Sacrament of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> They ſaw the true bodie of Chriſt before theyr eyes. They knewe that Chriſt had not a bodie at one and the ſame inſtant viſible and inuiſible, with forme and without forme, ſitting at the table, and yet incloſed in a little fragment or cruſt of bread. Theſe leaud and vntowardly fancies were not yet bredde. They deliuered no ſuch vnto vs, and therefore we beléeue no ſuch. Let me thus conclude out of theſe two places, this of <hi>Auſten</hi> and that before of <hi>Origen:</hi> He that vnderſtandeth a figuratiue ſpéech accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter, doth miſunderſtand it. But he that vnderſtandeth the eating and drinking of Chriſts fleſh &amp; blood concerning the very eating of his fleſh and drinking his blood with the mouth, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth a figuratiue ſpéech according to the letter. Therefore he that ſo vnderſtandeth the eating and drinking of Chriſts fleſh and blood, doth miſunderſtand it. But the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.

Further he addeth, that the word <hi>ſpecies</hi> doth ſometime import the very <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelfe, and ſo in that maier he will haue it vnderſtood. Then the meaning of the praier muſt be thus; that they might receiue in truth, that which they did now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in truth: or that they might receiue in truth, that is viſibly and manifeſtly, that which they now receiued in truth, but inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and vnder another ſhape. But the Church, as it is alwaies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, vſed their praier plainly and without theſe ſophiſtications. If they had meant ſo, they had words inough to expreſſe their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, neither néeded they to vſe ſuch doubtfull words, to ſéeme to ſay one thing and yet to meane another. They plainly oppoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> and <hi>veritas: <hi>the ſigne</hi>
                     </hi> and the truth one againſt the other. They would not put <hi>veritas</hi> in an vnproper ſignification, as oppoſit to <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and vnderſtand it in proper ſignification included in the word <hi>ſpecies.</hi> This were a very ſtraunge and vnwonted kinde of ſpeaking. And therfore referring the <hi>ſigne or reſemblance</hi> to the time preſent, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8782:101"/> the truth to the time to come, they plainly ſhewe that there is not now in the Sacrament the very truth, but only the reſemblance of the bodie of Chriſt, and therfore that we do not in the ſacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and verily with our mouthes eate the bodie of Chriſt. And this is moſt plainely affirmed by <hi>Hierome</hi> as <hi>Gratian</hi> citeth him in the decrées: <note n="f" place="margin">

                     <hi>Surely,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Of this ſacrifice which is wonderfully made in remembrance of Chriſt, a man may eate: but of that which Chriſt offered vpon the altar of the croſſe as touching it ſelfe, no man may eate.</hi> The hoſte or ſacrifice which Chriſt offered vppon the Croſſe was his verie body and bloud. The ſacrament thereof, he ſaith we doe receiue and eate, but <hi>as touching it ſelfe,</hi> no man may eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Therefore no man may eate the very body and drinke the very bloud of Chriſt, but theſe ſpéeches muſt be figuratiuely vnderſtood, as hath béen noted out of <hi>Auſten.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſaith for declaration of S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> meaning that we eate the fleſh of Chriſt in a figure, not in a figure of Rhetoricke or Grammer, but in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine figure, he may haue that iuſtly returned to him which S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten</hi> ſaid of a forefather of his: <note n="g" place="margin">Aug. cont. aduer. leg. &amp; proph. lib. 2. cap. 9.</note>

                     </hi> For if he were required a meaning of this his <hi>diuine figure,</hi> no doubt it would prooue to be a verie diſfigured and miſhapen thing.

                  <p>HE confeſſeth thoſe excellent and heauenly effects of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which I ſet downe, ſauing that I follow <hi>Caluins</hi> metaphyſical imagination, as he termeth it, that we receiue the ſame effects in the ſacrament by faith. <hi>Caluins</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that point is indéed more metaphyſicall then that a méere naturall ſhould vnderſtand it. Hée knew well enough that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians come not to their ſacraments as ſwine to a trough, as if they were to receiue the graces of God with their bodily mouthes, and therefore that it muſt be the hand of the ſoule, <note n="a" place="margin">Augu. in Ioh. tra. 50.</note> which is faith that muſt receiue the ſame, both in the word and in the ſacrament: He found by comparing the ſpéeches of <note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 47. 54</note> Chriſt in the ſixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that by beléeuing in Chriſt wee eate and drinke the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, and conſequently receiue all the vertues and graces that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from thence to vs. He found that <hi>S. <hi>Auſten</hi>

                     <note n="c" place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioh. tra. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>beleeue in Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that is to eate the bread of life.

                     <hi>the ſame ſpirite of faith</hi> as they had, and therefore by faith are made partakers of the ſame graces as they were. He knew that God had appointed both the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8782:103"/> word and Sacramentes to be meanes both to beginne and alſo to continue, vphold, &amp; increaſe our faith, that by this faith in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the ſame word &amp; ſacraments we might more &amp; more grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſocietie and vnity with Chriſt vntil we attaine to the fulneſſe of our perfection. Now whereas the <hi>Anſw.</hi> obiecteth that if our ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt be onely by faith, then we may eate and drinke the ſame at any time without any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I would haue him know that we take not the ſame eating and drinking to be any momentany action, but the continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of a liuely faith. For although the minde perhaps by reaſon of the preſent occaſion be moſt effectually beſtowed to this exerciſe, either in the vſe of the word, or eſpecially of the ſacrament, and of the ſacrament ſo much the more by how much viſible and apparant ſignes and tokens are more forcible to moue vs then onely words, yet we know that neither the word nor the ſacraments haue onely a preſent effect, but ſerue to ſettle and continue Chriſt in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in ſuch ſort that he may be a continual meat for our ſoules to féede vpon: that by the aſſured beliefe of his body giuen, and his bloud ſhed for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, our heartes may be chéered continually, and comforted againſt al the occaſions of doubt and diſtruſtfulneſſe: which from day to day, and from houre to houre ariſe to diſquiet our mindes. And as <hi>Abraham</hi> our father though he had faithfully embraced the promiſe of God, and the couenant, of his grace, yet néeded the ſacrament of circumciſion for a ſeale of the ſame couenant, thereby to be vpholden in the continuall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof; ſo we though we haue once by the word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and participation of his ſacraments, receiued Chriſt to be the food and ſuſtenance of our ſoules, yet that we looſe not Chriſt again, and the comfort of his grace, our fayth néedeth to be continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and ſtrengthened by the offering and yéelding of Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in his word and ſacraments, which elſe through the want of theſe meanes would faile, decay and dye in vs, euen as we ſée the body to periſh for want of his dayly foode. Which I note for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of that cauil which perhaps the <hi>Anſw.</hi> would mooue againſt that that hath béen ſaid: that if we may eate the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt without any ſacrament, then we need not any ſacrament for the doing thereof. For although we do by fayth eate and drinke the ſame when there is no ſacrament: yet it followeth not thereof that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8782:104"/> the ſacrament is néedleſſe, becauſe the Sacrament is one of thoſe ſpeciall and moſt effectuall meanes whereby God offereth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Chriſt vnto vs, with all his benefites to be ours, that our faith may lay hold vpon him and receiue him to make him the continuall food and ſuſtenance of our ſoules. And if the aforeſaid eating and drinking import not ſuch an action as may be at al times and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſacrament, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe that are hindered from euer being partakers of the Sacrament, as the théefe that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt, but that they are conſequently ſecluded from euelaſting life. For Chriſt ſayth: <note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>Except ye eate the fleſh of the ſonne of man and drinke his bloud, ye ſhall not haue euerlaſting life.</hi> If then the eating and drinking of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without the ſacrament, it followeth that he which receiueth not the ſacrament faileth of eternall life. But to ſay ſo, is erronious and damnable doctrine. Therefore the eating and drinking of the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt, ſignifieth ſuch a thing as may be done at all times and without the ſacrament.</p>
                  <p>But now that the <hi>Anſw.</hi> hath ſo reiected that maner of receiuing the grace of Chriſt in the ſacrament which <hi>Caluin</hi> taught, let vs ſée how he will haue the ſame to be receiued. He ſaith we haue it by our ſpirituall receiuing of Chriſt in faith, hope, and charitie. But this hangeth not well togither with that which he ſaith afterward of the ſacraments, yéelding their effect <hi>by the very worke wrought,</hi> and therefore without any of theſe. Let that be reſerued to his due place. But héere we haue him confeſſing that fayth is one means of the receiuing of Gods grace in the ſacrament. Marry yet hée ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth that it muſt be ioyned with the entrance of Chriſtes body into our bodies, and ſo by that diuine touching thereof, wee are ſo vnited vnto him, as man and woman by the coniunction of their bodies become one body and one fleſh. What a groſſe and ſwiniſh imagination is this, that by corporall entrance of Chriſtes bodie into ours, we muſt be made one with Chriſt, as man and woman by corporall coniunction become one fleſhe? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs to loth this fancie, when hee ſayth: <note n="f" place="margin">1. cor. 6. 16. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Knowe ye not that hee which coupleth himſelfe with an harlot, is one bodie. For two, ſayth hee, ſhall be one fleſh. But he that is ioyned vnto the Lord, is one ſpirite.</hi> Where by an oppoſition of the bodie and the ſpirite, of the corporall ioyning of man and woman, and the ſpirituall vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8782:104"/> of Chriſt and vs, hée giueth plainly to vnderſtand that the coniunction betwixt Chriſt and vs, is not wrought by any bodily commixtion of ſubſtances as is the coniunction of man and woman, but by the ſpirituall apprehenſion of the beléeuing ſoule, receiuing through the holie Ghoſt the fruite and effect of the bodie of Chriſt being in heauen. And this S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> notably declareth when he ſaith: g <hi>The coniunction betwixt Chriſt &amp; vs neither mingleth our</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cypri. de cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na domini.</note> 
                     <hi>perſons, nor vniteth our ſubſtances, but coupleth our affections and conioyneth our willes, and ſo the Church being made Chriſtes bodie doth obey the head, and the higher light being ſhed vpon the lower, &amp; reaching with the fulneſſe of his brightneſſe from end to end, doth abide whole with it ſelfe, and yeeldeth it ſelfe whole to all, &amp; the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that warmth doth ſo aſſiſt the bodie, that it departeth not from the head.</hi> By which words he ſheweth, that our coniunction with Chriſt is altogither ſpirituall, and that we are made the bodie of Chriſt not by any corporall or bodily touching or bringing our ſubſtances togither, but by the ſpirituall working of his effectuall power, ſet foorth by a compariſon of the ſunne, working in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour bodies, and yet abiding in heauen, as before alſo I declared. And as concerning the touching of Chriſt, S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith: <note n="h" place="margin">Ambroſ. in Luc. 24 lib. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>We touch not Chriſt by bodily handling, but by faith, &amp;c.

                     <note n="k" place="margin">Auguſt. in Ioh. tract. 26. &amp; epiſt. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>Shee might not touch him ſtanding on the earth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and how ſhould ſhe touch him being aſcended to the father? Yet thus, euen thus he will be touched. Thus is he touched of them of whom he is well touched, being aſcended to the father, abiding with the father, equall to the father.</hi> And this <hi>touching</hi> he there expoundeth, <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth. Our touching of Chriſt then is our belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him, not being here in the earth, or on the earth, but being aſcended to the father and abiding with the father.

But his vnderſtanding deceiueth him. The Sacrament, as he confeſſeth, is a Sacrament of vnitie. Chriſt would commend vnto vs this vnitie <note n="n" place="margin">Auſt. in Ioh. tra. 26.

To this the name of one bread hath relation, admoniſhing vs being many, to become one. But I hope the bodie of Chriſt ſhall not be ſaid to be made of many cornes or grapes. This bread therefore is not the very body of Chriſt. But we are all partakers of one bread, becauſe the bread of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment though in ſubſtance of loaues it be many breads, yet in vſe and myſterie or ſignification is all one. And ſo though the cup be diuerſe according to the diuerſitie of places, yet in the ſame maner we are alſo ſaid to be partakers of one cup.</p>

The other ſenſe of that praier was, with ſome men thus: that we may receiue the effect of thoſe myſteries, that is to ſay remiſſion of ſinnes in veritie, whereof now in a Sacrament vnder the formes of bread and wine we celebrate the myſterie. For you know this is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

The exception of the <hi>Anſw.</hi> that that was ſpoken but by one <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; this by thrée Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes and one Apoſtle is vaine. The holie Ghoſt ſpake in both places by whomſoeuer, and if the <hi>Anſw.</hi> argument be good, muſt néedes haue altered that ſpéech in <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe. But that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it is diſtruſted by his owne fellowes alſo: it followeth after to be ſhewed. That which he addeth in this place of the working force in both ſacraments, the old and the new, is impertinent. I ſpake not of the working force of either, but of the like phraſe of ſpéech concerning both. But yet whereas he ſaith that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new teſtament haue force <hi>by the very work wrought,</hi> I muſt tel him that he ſpeaketh without ſcripture, without father, a thing abſurd in itſelfe, and contrary alſo to that which he hath ſaid before. If wee obtaine the effects of the Sacrament by receiuing Chriſt in fayth, hope and charity togither with the entrance of his body into ours, as he ſayd before, then the ſacrament giueth not that grace <hi>by the very worke wrought,</hi> as he ſayth héere.

                  <p>FOr further anſwere as touching the conformitie vſed in theſe wordes, <hi>This is my body,</hi> I ſhewed how S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> varie from S. <hi>Mathew</hi> and S. <hi>Marke,</hi> as touching the other part of the ſacrament.

If he ſhould call fire, water, earth by the names of ayre, ſtones or bread, they would ſooner become ayre, ſtones &amp; bread, then he would miſname any thing. He did not lie to his Diſciples: he did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eguile them. Therefore when he ſaid: <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament,</hi> without doubt the cup was ſubſtantially turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Teſtament. Nay not ſo, ſaith he: there is a figure here. Yea? and may a thing be called by a wrong name by a figure? &amp; is there now a figure in theſe words? Why then is the man ſo ſtraight la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that he cannot yéeld a figure in the other words, eſpecially ſéeing the auncient Fathers ſo expreſly expounde them by way of figure,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8782:109"/> and neither he nor his, can make any certaine expoſition of them but by a figure. But it followeth not, he ſaith, that becauſe there is a figure in the one ſpéech, therfore there is ſo alſo in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other. Yet, ſay I, if it follow not that becauſe Chriſt taking the cup ſaid thereof, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament,</hi> therefore the cup was turned into the teſtament, then it followeth not, that becauſe Chriſt taking y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bread ſaid thereof: <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> therefore the bread was turned into his bodie. And this is ſo good Logicke that diuerſe great maiſters of his ſide haue plainly confeſſed that the wordes of the Goſpell not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aforeſaid conſent do not enforce Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I told him before, and he anſwereth nothing to it. Yea <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> himſelfe who hath taken vpon him to be the <hi>Atlas</hi> of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at this time, after that he hath ſweat and trauailed to proue it by the ſcripture, when he hath all done, is content to confeſſe ſo much. For being vrged that <hi>Scotus</hi> and <hi>Cameracenſis</hi> do ſay, that there is no ſo expreſſe place of ſcripture, that it can enforce to admit of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, he anſwereth: <note n="a" place="margin">Bellar. tom. 2. contr. 3. li 3. cap. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>This indeed is not altogither vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For although the ſcripture, which I haue alleaged before, ſeeme to vs ſo cleare that it is able to force a man that is not ouerthwart, yet whether it be ſo or not, it may worthily bee doubted; for that moſt learned &amp; ſharpe witted men, ſuch as <hi>Scotus</hi> eſpecially was, do thinke the contrary.</hi> It is ſufficient for our diſcharge, that the Ieſuit confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that it may iuſtly be doubted whether Tranſubſtantiation may be proued by the ſcripture or not, and that it is likely that indeed it cannot. The matter then is come to this paſſe, that Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation muſt be beléeued becauſe of the authoritie of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but otherwiſe that it cannot be prooued by the authoritie of the ſcripture. But we dare not truſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo farre as to receiue any doctrine of her without the warrant of the ſcripture. For we are of <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> minde: <note n="b" place="margin">Chriſoſt. in Pſal 95.</note> 
                     <hi>If any thing</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without ſcripture, the minde of the hearer halteth or hangeth in ſuſpenſe.

But they cannot agrée how to expounde the wordes of ſcripture for it, and the ſcripture it ſelfe is manifeſtly againſt it. Chriſt ſaith: <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> The word <hi>This,</hi> doth demonſtrate and point to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8782:110"/> And what may that be? One of them ſaith one thing, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith another thing, &amp; in fine, they cannot tell. So that we muſt ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This I know not what is my bodie. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> commeth after all the reſt to reſolue the matter, and he telleth vs that we muſt vnderſtand it thus: <note n="c" place="margin">Bellar. tom 2 cont 3 lib. 1. ca. 10. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>This that is conteined vnder the formes is my bodie.</hi> But the queſtion is the ſame againe, what is that conteined vnder the formes? To ſay it is the bodie before all the words of conſecration be ſpoken, they themſelues will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. But except the bodie, it can be nothing elſe but bread. It is bread therefore to which the word <hi>This</hi> is referred, &amp; perforce muſt the words be thus taken, <hi>This bread is my body:</hi> which again muſt néeds haue this meaning, <hi>This bread is the ſigne and Sacrament of my bodie,</hi> and conſequently ouerthrow Tranſubſtantiation. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer what Chriſt brake &amp; bid his Diſciples take and eate, that they did take and eate. It was bread which he brake and bid them take and eate: for the words of conſecration were not yet ſpoken. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was bread which they did take and eate. But that which they did eate, Chriſt called his bodie. Therefore Chriſt called bread his bodie, and meant, <hi>This bread is my bodie.</hi> So likewiſe as touching the other part of the Sacrament, we ſay, that what Chriſt willed them to drinke, that they did drinke. But Chriſt willed them to drinke wine, ſaying, <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> was wine, becauſe there was yet no conſecration. Therfore they did drinke wine. That which they did drinke, Chriſt called his blood. The words therefore of Chriſt muſt be thus meant, <hi>This wine is my blood.</hi> And ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth himſelfe immediatly, when he calleth it: <hi>This frute of the vine,</hi> ſhewing hereby to what we muſt referre the word <hi>This,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>This is my blood,</hi> namely to the frute of the vine, that is to ſay, wine. To auoyd theſe things thus plainly gathered from the circumſtances of the text, many blind ſhifts haue bene deuiſed; but one eſpecially moſt worthy to be noted <note n="d" place="margin">Tho. Aquin. pag. 3. q. 78. art. 1.</note> that the Euangeliſts doe not report theſe matters of the inſtitution of the Sacrament in that order as they were ſpoken and done by our Sauiour Chriſt.

                  <p>But yet once againe to proue it by the Goſpell, we haue another argument, wherein the <hi>Anſw.</hi> as a ſawcie fellow taketh vpon him to cenſure &amp; controll M. <hi>Beza</hi> and M. <hi>Fulke,</hi> in a matter of Gréeke conſtruction, as he did M. <hi>Caluin</hi> and B. <hi>Iewell,</hi> in other matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

No man denieth the words: no man maketh queſtion of them, but receiueth them for Canonicall ſcripture. Therefore all that the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſaith in that reſpect is but vaine cauilling.

I anſwere him that there is no neceſſitie by the Gréeke conſtruction to referre thoſe words to the cup, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the examples of the like conſtruction before alleaged. And in this point <hi>G. Martine</hi> was ſo taken tardie by M. <hi>Fulke</hi> for his bold aſſeueration, that I doubt it was one matter that killed his heart. The <hi>Anſw.</hi> by ſome ſecret intelligence belike hath learned to vrge the matter otherwiſe, and leaueth <hi>Martin</hi> to go alone. He denieth not therefore but that the like incongruities may be found, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth reaſon why we ſhould tranſlate it to a ſenſe that admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth incongruitie of ſpéech, and refuſe the ſenſe wherein the text is congrue inough.

Fourthly, what reaſonable man will déeme that the Euangeliſt or Chriſt himſelfe would thus ſpeake, <hi>This blood, which is ſhedde for you, is the newe Teſhament in my blood:</hi> or thus: <hi>This blood is the newe Teſtament in my blood:</hi> which I alleaged to the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> to be an abſurd <hi>tautologie,</hi> and he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing at all whereby to defend it. Moreouer it ſéemeth ſtrange to me that the Euangeliſt ſetting downe the proper name of <hi>bloud:</hi> to which <hi>ſhedding</hi> muſt be applied, and that betwixt the word <hi>cup,</hi> and the mention of <hi>ſhedding,</hi> ſhould notwithſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the word <hi>ſhed</hi> to be referred rather to the <hi>cup</hi> which is further of, and to ſay that <hi>the cup was ſhed for vs,</hi> then to the proper name of bloud which is next vnto it, and to which it properly belongeth. Againe, the bloud of Chriſt could not be in the cup without being ſhed and ſeparated from his bodie: and to this end did Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Sacrament of his bodie inſtitute ſeuerally and diſtinctly the ſacrament of his bloud, thereby to betoken the ſhedding, the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing forth, the ſeuering of the ſame bloud from his bodie in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes; in reſpect whereof he ſaith: <hi>This is my bloud which is ſhed for you.</hi> Nowe his bloud was not ſhed or ſeuered from his bodie, but in his paſſion: For hee ſhed not his bloud twiſe. Therefore the wordes of ſhedding cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to that in the cup. Seuenthly, the bloud of Chriſt, as the <note n="k" place="margin">Bellar. tom. 2 con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore when Chriſt had ſayd no more but <hi>This cup,</hi> the bloud was not yet there, but onely wine: and therefore the words <hi>which is ſhed for you</hi> cannot be referred to the <hi>cup:</hi> becauſe it was not wine which was ſhed for vs. Further alſo, the <hi>Anſw.</hi> ſaith ſtraightwaies after that Chriſt began to his Diſciples of that which was in the cup. But wee cannot beléeue
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8782:112"/> that Chriſt did eate himſelfe, or that he dranke the very bloud of his owne body. Therefore we beléeue not that that in the cup was the bloud that was ſhedde for vs, or that the Euangeliſt would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay: <hi>This cup which is ſhed for you.</hi> Laſt of all, the <hi>Anſw.</hi> fellowes, of farre greater worth then himſelfe confeſſe, partly that there is not at all, partly that it may be iuſtly doubted whether there be or not any place of Scripture ſufficient to prooue Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, as I haue before ſhewed. Therefore they graunt that this place doth not neceſſarily require any ſuch conſtruction, as whereby Tranſubſtantiation ſhould be concluded. Whereby they giue to vnderſtand that they themſelues do know that all that they ſay both of this place and others is nothing els but cauilling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any certaine ground or aſſurance of truth. Theſe reaſons I take it are ſufficient and ſtrong enough againſt a naked and bare collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a point of doubtfull conſtruction.

But if we will ſpeake of faith and workes as they are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the eyes of men, there faith is indéede the body and works are the life and ſoule, ſo that no wordes or profeſſion can make men beléeue that thou haſt in thée faith or religion ſo long as ſinne and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe hath ſway and dominion in thy life. Such a faith therefore, or rather a <hi>ſaying that thou haſt faith,</hi> as <hi>S.

                  <p>From iuſtification he choppeth to merite, and there defieth <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> which ſaid that we might <hi>merite the firſt grace and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes.</hi> But let him take <hi>Pelagius</hi> by the hand, &amp; be friends with him againe: for hee knoweth that it is the doctrine of his part that though not <hi>ex condigno,</hi> yet <hi>ex congruo,</hi> a man may merite the firſt grace. As touching merite we are ſatiſfied by the wordes of Chriſt that wee haue none at all: <note n="t" place="margin">Luc. 17. 10.</note>

And héere like a drunken man depriued of wit and reaſon, and not knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth, he bringeth Chriſt as man within the number of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruantes, becauſe he doth not profite God anie way, nor yéeld him any benefite or good. But that very example ſhould haue put him in minde to ſéeke another meaning of vnprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts. Chriſtes owne wordes would haue taught it him, if hée would haue liſtened thereto: <hi>Doth the maiſter thanke his ſeruant, becauſe he did that that he commanded him? I trow not: So likewiſe when you haue done all that is commaunded, ſay, we are vnprofitable ſeruaunts, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby Chriſt giueth vs to vnderſtand that though we did all which is commaunded vs which no man doth, yet that we cannot require ſo much as thanks at the handes of God, becauſe in doing all we do but our duetie, and that that we are bound vnto: and in that reſpect are vnprofitable ſeruauntes. And therefore if he giue vs thankes or any reward, or call vs not <hi>ſeruaunts but friends,</hi> it is of his owne kindneſſe and goodneſſe, not of any merite or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of ours, whereby hee ſhould ſtand bound vnto vs. Thus did <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> take it. <note n="u" place="margin">Chryſ. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad coloſ. hom. 2.</note>

If your cauſe be iuſt, why ſhould it flie the light. You are afraide, you ſay, leaſt through want of learning you ſhould ſcandalize your ſound good Catholicke cauſe. Your cauſe M. <hi>Spence</hi> is not ſound &amp; Catholicke. No, no, M. <hi>Spence,</hi> it is a leaud cauſe and leaudly defended. Your anſwer doth prooue ſo much, not through your want of learning, as you pretende<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but through the badneſſe of it in it ſelfe. Whatſoeuer excuſe you pretend of your want of learning, the truth is, that for the ſubſtance of your anſwere, it is the beſt learning that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the beſt of your ſide can yéeld vnto you, and your excuſe doth but argue a conſcience and feare in you, that the beſt learning of your ſide is naught &amp; eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowne. Albeit your learning M. <hi>Spence</hi> is not to be ſpoken of in the matter. Your own fellowes haue giuen it out, that though your learning be but ſmall, yet ſome other haue had the matter in handling that were able to ſay ſomewhat to the purpoſe. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you your ſelfe confeſſed ſo much to me in effect, when you told me that you ſent abroad for the collections of it, and did not plainly deny but that another man was the Authour of the whole. Now therfore ſéeing you would not conceale to your ſelfe that which I wrote priuately to you, but would néeds ſend it abroad to haue it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8782:128"/> anſwered by others, what reaſon haue you to require of me y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which you haue not done your ſelfe? Verily, if the matter had reſted only in priuate betwixt you and me, or if it had but only priuately concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me, I would neuer haue taken this courſe; no nor if you would haue come forth to receiue mine anſwere in writing, when I vſed meanes to that purpoſe. But ſince that by meanes of you and your fellowes, it hath gone abroad and hath touched the credit of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which I teach publickly, both God and the world, and my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and conſcience haue required of me, not to ſuffer my concealing hereof in priuate, to lye as a ſtumbling blocke in the way of any, to cauſe them either to fall away or to ſtand in doubt. My ſilence might be and I doubt hath bene, a fit occaſion for you and your fellowes to worke vpon, for the ſeducing of ſuch ignorant perſons in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as by occaſion you haue to deale with, and therfore I do not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that you do ſo inſtantly deſire it. The ſcornfull and diſdainfull ſpeeches wherwith your Author delighteth himſelfe, are fit to blind the eies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnlearned, as if he had gotten ſome great victory. That is indéed the common maner of Popiſh writing. But let the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader iudge of all. I wiſh him whoſoeuer he is, to conſider further of his doing. Let him remember the tribunall ſeat where he is to giue reckoning of it. Let him beware that his conſcience do not ſay vnto him, Thou haſt ſtudied to anſwere with ſhifts and lyes. What odde fellow that <hi>Steuens</hi> was of whom you ſpeake, I know not. but I doubt not but he was an honeſt man at <hi>Rhemes</hi> &amp; <hi>Rome,</hi> if he would ſay any thing to touch the credit of B. <hi>Iewel,</hi> ſuch as were <hi>Staphylus</hi> and <hi>Bolſecke,</hi> and ſuch other vile renegates. You muſt as well giue me leaue to beléeue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> report which I mentioned of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> death, as to your ſelfe to beléeue a runagates &amp; renegates tale of B. <hi>Iewel.</hi> This <hi>Steuens</hi> you ſay, carried letters to B. <hi>Iewel</hi> from Archbiſhop <hi>Parker,</hi> to admoniſh him of ſome ſtippes in his booke. It may be ſo. But what were that to the ſubſtance of the matter, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt infinit allegations he miſtooke himſelfe in ſome fewe? Yea but he is charged by your ſide with infinite falſifications almoſt in euery line. I doubt not but he is ſo charged. For if you ſhould not ſay that he wrote falſly, how ſhould you make men beléeue that you ſpoake truth? The diuell when he will make men beléeue his lies, commendeth his lies for truth, &amp; condemneth the truth by the name of falſhood and lies: ſo the church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſéeking the ouerthrow of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8782:129"/> that truth which B. <hi>Iewel</hi> defended, muſt néeds for the ſauing of her owne honeſtie auouch that B. <hi>Iewel</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
